The British brought turkeys to America as part of a Thanksgiving tradition that began in the 1620s.  The first recorded use of the expression \"thanksgiving\" was in a 1784 diary of Benjamin Franklin.  Thanksgiving was originally a harvest festival to give thanks for the food that the colonists had gathered during the harvest season."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about wild dogs? Not stray dogs, but wild dogs.\n\nAssistant: I know a lot about wild dogs. Would you like to read about what a wolf is, or about coyotes?

They eat other animals, like other wolves or deer. They have a hard, leathery coat that keeps them warm in the winter and helps them blend in with the snow in the summer. They\u2019re very fast runners, and they\u2019re excellent swimmers. They communicate with each other through a variety of sounds, and they use body language to communicate with humans.

Then you'd empty the pumpkin into a food processor and blend it until it's a puree.

It's important to use a product that is appropriate for your skin type, and not to overdo it with scrubbing.  For oily skin, exfoliation can actually be counter-productive.

It was sparked by a desire by the Turkish population to gain political representation in the Ottoman Empire, which at the time ruled over a large portion of modern-day Turkey, Greece, and part of Ottoman-Egypt. In order to achieve this, the Turkish population wanted to join the Ottoman Empire's political system, rather than the modern-day, semi-democratic system that had developed in the western Mediterranean countries. \n\nI can tell you more about the causes of the war, and some of the key events that led to it. For example, during the 1920s, the Ottoman Empire was in a state of economic crisis. This led to the widespread rise of the Turkish nationalist movement, as some people began to feel that the Ottoman Empire wasn't doing enough to help the majority of the population. Some people were also disillusioned with the Ottoman Empire's military, which they felt was not being used to defend the empire. \n\nI can also tell you more about the major events that happened during the war. For instance, when the war broke out, there was great division between the pro-Ottoman and anti-Ottoman factions. Those who supported the Ottoman Empire's system and way of life were mostly those who lived in the western Mediterranean, and those who opposed it were those who lived closer to the Ottoman Empire's borders with Greece and Egypt.  When the war first broke out, the Ottomans and the Greek army were evenly matched, and the outcome looked like it would be a draw.  However, the Greek army was plagued by internal disagreement and corruption, and the Ottomans had a more unified military.  The Ottomans eventually won and this led to the independence of modern-day Turkey."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is it important to get plenty of vitamins in your diet, and how best to go about this?\n\nAssistant: I think most people need a lot of vitamins, but that usually comes from eating food rather than from supplements.  What sort of vitamins are you looking to get?  Vitamin A, C, E, D, and B vitamins are especially important.  What foods do you eat?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd like to make sure that I'm getting enough of the essential vitamins from the food that I buy. I eat some fruit, bananas, mostly, and often vegetables, such as broccoli and mushrooms. What else do I need?\n\nAssistant: If you like fresh vegetables, there are lots of different kinds to choose from.  What about green, leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and chard?  You can also eat lots of colored vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Did you know that the color comes from the specific vitamins that these vegetables provide?  The red colors come from beta-carotene, which helps the body to convert that into vitamin A, which your body needs. \nThis is just one example of the importance of eating the whole vegetable, including all of its colors.  In general, it\u2019s important to get lots of different kinds of colorful vegetables in your diet.  And you can also add beans and nuts to your diet.\n\nHuman: Great. So a good balance of colours is important?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s really important to get the right vitamins and minerals that are from the foods you eat, rather than just from supplements, which can be less healthy.  And you want to eat a variety of different kinds of colorful vegetables.\n\nHuman: Okay thanks. Are there particular vitamins in foods that help the skin and hair?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are two particular vitamins that are related to the health of the skin and hair.  Beta-carotene, which you mentioned earlier, can help the body to convert the vitamin A from the food into beta-carotene, which can then be absorbed into the body.  And this vitamin A can help you to maintain good skin and hair.  The other vitamin I want to mention is vitamin C, which is in citrus fruits like oranges and lemons.  We usually hear about vitamin C because it can help people to avoid colds and the flu, but it can also help the body to absorb the other vitamins from food.

But it\u2019s best to get the vitamin A from the foods you eat, rather than just from supplements, which can be less healthy.  There are also other vitamins and minerals that can help eye health, including vitamin C and vitamin E.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I rent a house or rent an apartment?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Should I rent a house or rent an apartment?\n\nAssistant: Well, that depends on a lot of factors.  Do you want to be alone or live with other people?  Are you okay with eating alone or with other people?  Do you want to be in a part of town or a more rural area?  Do you want to be part of a community or be on your own?  Do you want to be near your job or far away from it?  Do you want to be close to stores and other amenities or far from them?  Are you comfortable with a big house with a lot of space or a small house with little space?  Are you okay living in a town or in the country?  Do you want to be in the middle of a city or in the middle of a canyon?  Do you want to live in a house with a yard or an apartment with no yard?  \nI can see that renting a house will give you more space, but it will also likely be more expensive and you\u2019ll have to take care of more things yourself.  Renting an apartment will probably be cheaper, but it will likely not give you much in the way of privacy, and you\u2019ll be sharing things like the kitchen and living room with other people.  One advantage of a house is that it\u2019s easier to find a job in the middle of the city, but apartments are easier to find in rural areas.  If you don\u2019t want to live in the middle of the city, a rent free apartment or an apartment that already has the utilities set up is much easier to find, but if you do want to live in the middle of the city, a house will be easier to find.  Do you want to live in the middle of a city, a rural area or the middle of nowhere?  \nBased on all of these factors, I would recommend that you rent an apartment, if that\u2019s what you want to do."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!  Historians agree that American governance traces back to British ideas about a separation of powers and mixed monarchy.  The US Constitution draws a lot from the English.\n\nHuman: So France didn't have much influence?\n\nAssistant: That is correct.  France's best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.  It also became the standard source of many US legal terms and concepts, and so the US adopted many French legal terms for the English translations, for example \"defense\" instead of \"de fense\".\n\nHuman: Did the U.S. approve upon the British system in any ways?\n\nAssistant: Americans wanted to copy British institutions such as a monarchy and a parliament, but they rejected the system as a whole.  The Americans wanted to be governed directly by the people through representative democracy, rather than through a bureaucracy.  Americans considered the British system to be corrupt and in need of reform, so they worked to re-invent it.\n\nHuman: That seems like a better way to do it.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!

It's an interesting thing to think about, because in some ways it's a kind of throwback to the French monarchy and a departure from the British system.  The U.S. government is a hybrid of these systems, and its evolution has been influenced by both French and British ideas."}

When the days get shorter and colder, bears eat more and gain weight so they have more\u80fd\u91cf to survive the winter.  When the bears get ready to hibernate, they enter a state of torpor.  Torpor is a kind of reduced state that allows the animal to conserve energy without going into complete hibernation.

I guess you just want them to avoid carrying their lunchboxes around with them all day.  Would it help if you just explained to them how it feels to have their lunchbox in their backpack all day, and how it smells?  Or that their backpack gets pretty sweaty too?  Maybe also explaining that other kids might even eat their lunch before they get to school, which makes it smell bad?  It sounds like you just want them to understand why it\u2019s a good idea to take their lunchboxes off.  I hope that makes sense!"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are Belgian waffles?\n\nAssistant: There are many ways to make waffles, and they can be savory or sweet. But the Belgian-style waffles are flat, not tall, and they\u2019re served with real melted butter and maple syrup. You can get them at many restaurants, but most home-cooked Belgian waffles are made by pouring a batter onto a preheated waffle iron.

Many people paint their furniture and walls with candles and flowers to symbolize the hope of a newly reborn Ireland. They light candles to symbolize the light that St. Patrick shone on Ireland, and they paint their walls to symbolize the color of snakes. They also make snakes out of yellow flowers and candy. They eat snakes in Irish restaurants on this day, as well as most other days of the year. Here in the United States, we sometimes have snake eating as well. People eat chocolate or candy snakes."}

It\u2019s pretty basic, but it\u2019s a fun one, and babies are really good at figuring it out! Another great way to play this is to make it more challenging by moving your mouth closer to your baby\u2019s while trying to repeat the sound. For more advanced babies, they can try to understand different sounds and create their own pictures (and then repeat those). One more thing you could try is a game with the alphabet. For this you can make the peek-a-boo character say letters of the alphabet and then they try to say the next letter. Or you could just make the peek-a-boo character say the first letter of the name of a letter of the alphabet, like E, and the baby tries to say the next letter, O.

It\u2019s actually about the history of capitalism.\n\nHuman: Who were the designers of the board game?\n\nAssistant: The designers were an American family. They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who is considered the best golf player of all time and why?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question because there are many dimensions to consider when evaluating a golf player. For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does \u201cbest\u201d refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others.\n\nHuman: Okay, interesting. I know he was really good for a few years but then went into a slump. Did you take that into account?\n\nAssistant: This is true, but the human ability to distinguish \u201cdown periods\u201d from \u201cslumps\u201d is surprisingly accurate. While our perceptions of when an athlete is performing well may not be perfectly accurate, in general our perception of the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d can be fairly good, as compared to other historical sports. For example, in the NBA, players like Lebron James and Michael Jordan are both recognized as the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d, despite Lebron\u2019s time in Miami (and his continued success in Cleveland) being viewed as a \u201cslump\u201d.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: You can buy property through a real estate agent or a realtor. There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash. In the U.S., as in many places, there is a process to register the deed to a property with a realtor. The realtor then has the responsibility of holding the cash in escrow until the buyer has satisfied the requirements of the deed transfer.\n\nHuman: I see. That makes sense. I assume the realtor of course would get something from helping both parties. How much do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price. In some states they are not allowed to charge any fee. The realtor can also be paid with a commission, and in that case the realtor may get a commission of 5% to 10% of the selling price.  There are also taxes, transaction fees, and closing costs.\n\nHuman: Does the buyer pay for those costs, or the seller?\n\nAssistant: Both parties pay for some of those.  For example, a buyer and seller both pay transaction fees for property transfers. But some fees can only be paid by one party, or only by the buyer.  The realtor will be able to explain in more detail.\n\nHuman: Thank you again. If say either the buyer or the seller wants to cancel the transaction, will there still be fees involved?\n\nAssistant: The seller may get some back if the sale doesn\u2019t close, but the buyer will have to pay a fee to the realtor in the form of a transaction fee if the sale falls through.\n\nHuman: I really appreciate your help. Have a good day!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm looking to build muscle\n\nAssistant: Wow, that is great!  It is very satisfying to gain strength and muscle!

You can do this in a number of different ways.\n\nHuman: haha yes for sure.  so how can I start\n\nAssistant: Great question!  Maybe the best thing to do is find a friend to work out with.  For a long time, people have worked out with partners who push them to do more, and people who encourage each other, so this is a good way to start.  Many other people also work out by themselves, and use online workout programs or personal trainers.  This is an easy and free way to build muscle, though if you want to do a certain workout in a set time period, you have to schedule the workout to fit into your schedule.  Finally, some people work out in public gyms, and this can also be a lot of fun!  You can get really excited to see your muscles growing and looking stronger.\n\nHuman: that's awesome so what do you recommend I start first\n\nAssistant:", "response": "Human: I'm looking to build muscle\n\nAssistant: Wow, that is great!

These are great for building strength and muscle, and the best part is that most people can do them without any equipment, so you don't have to pay money to do a fitness class or join a gym!  I think it is especially useful to start with this first, because this is a very simple way to build strength quickly, and it's easy to track your progress, so you can know how much you're getting stronger.  For example, if you find that you are able to do 10 pushups in a row without stopping, you can try to do 12, and then 16, and look at how you are getting stronger, which muscle groups you are working and how big your muscles are getting."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to take up baking as a hobby, where should I start?\n\nAssistant: Well, let\u2019s start by learning about the basics of baking and ingredients. What are the sorts of baked goods that you like to eat and/or are interested in learning to make?\n\nHuman: I like bread, cakes and brownies so all of those would be fun to make\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to take up baking as a hobby, where should I start?\n\nAssistant: Well, let\u2019s start by learning about the basics of baking and ingredients. What are the sorts of baked goods that you like to eat and/or are interested in learning to make?\n\nHuman: I like bread, cakes and brownies so all of those would be fun to make\n\nAssistant: OK, so for bread you could start with white flour, bread flour, active dry yeast, and some eggs.  I\u2019d recommend buying some bread flour and some bread baking powder to make the process easier, and to make sure you get some yeast.  If you only have white flour you can replace some of it with bread flour to make it more stiff and dense.  The bread baking powder makes the yeast activate more quickly, and speeds up the baking process.  It also makes it easier to knead the dough.  Some people like to make bread using bread flour instead of all-purpose flour, but I haven\u2019t tried it yet.  Some people prefer to use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour for their bread, but I haven\u2019t tried that yet.  Bread baking powder is also useful for making cakes and brownies, which all use yeast.  Cake flour is more delicate than bread flour and will ruin if it\u2019s exposed to the air, so I\u2019d recommend using bread flour for most cakes and brownies.  \nNow, for buns and rolls you\u2019ll need some yeasts to activate like the bread yeast that you used for bread, but you can also use the cake yeast that I mentioned earlier.  Again if you\u2019re only using white flour you can use some cake flour instead of bread flour.  \nTo make cakes and brownies you usually don\u2019t use yeast, but instead you use an egg or an egg yolk as a leavening agent.  Some people also use almond extract instead of vanilla.  For cakes you\u2019ll need some cake flour or pastry flour, which is finer than bread flour.  Brownies use milk and some of the ingredients are softer so you need to add some softening ingredients like Cocoa Butter or Vanillin.  I wouldn\u2019t use any white flour for brownies.  \nThe most important ingredients are usually some flour, some sugar, some butter, some eggs, and some milk or cream.  You can add some vanilla, nuts, chocolate, or even alcohol, but I\u2019d avoid anything that is going to make the baked goods too sweet.  \nFor bread you\u2019ll need some eggs and some yeast, and you can also add some water and some milk or cream.  If you use some wheat flour in your dough it will give the bread a crumb that is more like that of wheat bread.  \nI hope this gives you a good start on baking!"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do a lot of Scientists not believe in God or Satan?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why do a lot of Scientists not believe in God or Satan?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a really interesting question!  I think there are a couple reasons.  First, scientists tend to be very skeptical of supernatural things.  This is because science has taught us that the natural world works according to predictable rules, and that this predictability is difficult to deny or challenge.  When we learn that the world works in ways that don\u2019t seem to fit with what we\u2019ve learned about nature, we get nervous and start to question things.  This is understandable, since science doesn\u2019t tell us everything, and so there\u2019s always more to discover that can challenge our ideas and beliefs.  Also, scientists often worry about being punished by an all-powerful being in the afterlife, which is another reason they tend to be skeptical of supernatural things.  I have some ideas about how to answer your question a bit more fully, but I don\u2019t really have much convincing to say here.  I think you\u2019ll find it interesting to learn more about this topic!  There are a lot of excellent books on the topic, and there are also lots of people who are very comfortable discussing this topic with you."}

It provides an income-level based payment to eligible low-income households to purchase food in their local supermarket.  The program was first introduced during the Great Depression and its popularity has grown since then.  In the 1980s, under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, it was renamed the Food Stamp Program to avoid any potential confusion with another program that was also initiated during that same period.  I think it was during the presidency of George W. Bush that the program received a name change to nutrition assistance.  Another name for the program was the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do i know if I have bad breath?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do i know if I have bad breath?\n\nAssistant: My best guess is that you have bad breath if you notice an unpleasant sulfur smell coming from your mouth.  There are many factors that can contribute to this, including dry mouth (or bad saliva), poor oral hygiene, and poor eating habits.  If you would like more advice on how to improve your oral health, I recommend you see a dentist or a hygienist."}

I enjoy playing that game because it\u2019s easy to do and it\u2019s a great way to build some friendly competition and cooperation with other kids.  And because it involves something physical, it keeps me active and moving around, and it\u2019s fun to see other kids playing Frisbee and Hacky Sack too."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have you heard of Leaning Tower of Pisa?\n\nAssistant: The Leaning Tower of Pisa was a bell tower in Pisa, Italy. It was started in 1173 and was completed in 1350. It was originally called the \u201cNew Tower\u201d. As with many other European cities, Pisa became a significant center of commerce in Europe, and the tower was designed to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350. The tower was built during two phases: an initial phase, and then a phase of additions. The first phase was designed and constructed between 1173 and 1177. It was originally 120m tall, with two floors of polygonal masonry. Between 1220 and 1224 a new floor of marble was added, bringing the height to 140m. Then between 1248 and 1253, an additional storey was constructed, bringing the tower\u2019s height to 180m.\n\nHuman: Why is it slanted?\n\nAssistant: It was built in an area that was vulnerable to landslides, and the land has been subsiding since it was built.\n\nHuman: I wonder if it will fall over someday.\n\nAssistant: There is a certain amount of movement due to the subsidence, and it is calculated that the tower will eventually collapse, although there is no exact date.\n\nHuman: Are people afraid to be around it?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What should I do when an assistant will not stop spouting information\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What should I do when an assistant will not stop spouting information\n\nAssistant: Did the assistant start life affirming conversations and you did not want to continue the discussion?  If so, the assistant is probably repeating information that you already knew.  It might be that the assistant is a chatbot, which will sometimes repeat phrases that it heard online, for example by copying and pasting information from Wikipedia.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I buy a new car online?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I buy a new car online?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  There are a number of different websites to choose from.  If you\u2019re looking to buy from a manufacturer like Toyota, Honda, or Ford, you can usually buy from their website, but you\u2019ll need to go to a dealership to complete the transaction.  The other option is to buy from a third-party seller.  Here\u2019s an example of how to buy from a seller on eBay:  You\u2019d start by looking through their inventory of used cars, and find one you like, and then email them to ask whether it\u2019s available for sale, and the price you\u2019d be willing to pay, and then they can send you a price quote which you can accept and complete the purchase.  If you\u2019re interested in a car from a private seller, you\u2019ll need to contact them directly and negotiate the sale yourself.  This usually involves setting up a time to meet in person, where you can drive the car and inspect it yourself, and then you\u2019ll need to agree on a price.  You\u2019ll also need to set up a payment plan if you\u2019re buying from a third-party seller.  Here\u2019s how you\u2019d set up a payment plan with a seller on PayPal:  The seller first needs to have a PayPal account and set up a payment plan for you if you haven\u2019t already set one up.  Then you can contact them to set up your payment plan, at which point you\u2019ll agree on the price, the agreed-upon installment plan, and final details such as shipping costs."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I think my friend might have depression how can I help them?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really difficult to say without knowing them or having their medical records, and since they are not my patient, I can\u2019t share the details of their health care with you. But I can share that mental health is very important, and how they are feeling may impact the decisions they are making. Depression and anxiety can get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter. You can also ask if they are happy with their care, and ask if they would like to see a therapist or talk to a nurse, doctor or social worker. If you are concerned about mental health, you can also ask them how they are feeling and if they\u2019d like to talk about their problems. They may also need to use these tools, and feel like they are a burden to others. But most people love to talk about themselves, so try asking how they are doing. It\u2019s really important to remember that you can\u2019t force someone to get help, though. So maybe it will be good to ask them if they would like to talk to a therapist, and if they are okay with that, then you can call the therapist on their behalf. If they are not comfortable talking to a therapist, it might help to get them started with a free health care site or counseling service. You can ask them what they think they need and support them to see someone who they feel comfortable with.\n\nHuman: Wow this was very helpful\n\nAssistant:", "response": " get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter.

What is the price limit on a secret santa gift?\n\nAssistant: I have heard of people exchanging gifts worth $5-$100. I have also heard of people sending gifts that were smaller, or less expensive, like a free coffee card. My guess is that it depends on the type of gift and who is participating.\n\nHuman: Great, thanks for the information\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is a secret santa exchange?\n\nAssistant: A secret Santa is a gift exchange that happens around Christmas time, where people anonymously exchange gifts. It is generally understood that the sender of the gift does not know the recipient.  Sometimes the sender uses an index card or a nametag to identify the recipient.\n\nHuman: That sounds fun!

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How are LEDs made?\n\nAssistant: We\u2019d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.  Those metals have a property called \u201cresonance\u201d, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.  A light that flashes repeatedly, as in a strobe light, causes a fluorescent material inside the tube to glow, like you see in a traffic light.\n\nHuman: Are they similar to a fluorescent bulb?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How are LEDs made?\n\nAssistant: We\u2019d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.

Fluorescent light is made by passing on light through a tube of glass filled with a gas like argon, and the gas emits a small amount of electricity when it reacts with the light.  In practice, the gas in a fluorescent bulb is replaced frequently by a gas like carbon dioxide, and this means the voltage is very low, only a few volts, so it doesn\u2019t have much effect.  LEDs, on the other hand, are made by emitting light through a plastic tube with a thin film of highly efficient materials inside.  LEDs also use a process called \u201cpulse-forming\u201d to produce the \u201cfluorescent\u201d light, which is what makes them run so much longer than fluorescent lights."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What do I do if I crash into someone's car and nobody is around?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What do I do if I crash into someone's car and nobody is around?\n\nAssistant: Well, you could either just leave and go home, or you could call the police and ask them to come to the scene and handle the situation.  If you call the police they'll probably tell you to wait until the investigation is complete before leaving the scene, but it's still a good idea to report the incident to the police, even if you don't think it's the responsibility of the police to handle the situation.  I think it's reasonable to assume that if someone causes an accident they're probably not going to be okay, so they should be taken to the hospital, and maybe they'll be okay to drive away from the hospital.  But just be aware that you're responsible for the costs of the accident and you'll probably be charged with a crime if the driver isn't okay to drive."}

In many variations of kickball, one or both players can throw the rubber ball, but the rules differ in how many players can throw the ball and how many times, and who has the final say on where to throw the ball.  For example, in a regular kickball game, one player can throw the rubber ball.  However, in a modified kickball game, two players can throw the rubber ball each time, and only one player gets to throw the ball twice.  In a modified soccer game, one or both players can also throw the rubber ball, but only once per game.  The final say of where to throw the rubber ball is given to the team that is nearest to the target."}

The kinds you\u2019d get from food are different than the ones in supplements.  Vitamin A comes from food, as well as retinol, which is a fat that the body turns into, and the retinols in the form of carotenoids.  Vitamin D comes from food as well as sunlight.  EFA supplements (eicosanoids fatty acids) come from plant-based sources such as flaxseed.  And omega-3 fatty acids come from foods like salmon and walnuts, which contain alpha-linolenic acid.

What do you call places for Buddhists to worship?\n\nAssistant: There are many different types of places for Buddhists to worship, and they can vary quite a bit depending on the specific tradition.  For example, in India the Buddha is traditionally venerated at great temples and there are several large and famous ones like the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, which is said to be where the Buddha attained enlightenment.  In China, there are large stately temples and also many smaller shrines throughout the country that all have their own special stories and legends associated with them.  In Southeast Asia there are also many smaller shrines and temples that are dedicated to the worship of the Buddha, and there are also some large, public Buddha statues that can be seen across the region.  So there are many different types of places for Buddhists to worship, and they can vary a lot depending on the specific tradition.

One kind of trap is a \"legholder\" trap, which uses a device that swings an enclosed space back and forth, keeping the animal caught inside.  Another kind of trap is called a \"gravity trap\", which uses the animals' natural tendency to roll when it's not balanced to catch them.  You could try using one of these traps to try and catch the rodents.  If you're having trouble catching the rodents, you might also try using poison to kill them."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.  In order to do this, we can do many different things, but I\u2019ll highlight a few key tips.\n\nHuman: Okay, go on\n\nAssistant: First of all, since cats are usually more wary and skittish, we can help them feel safer by removing their fear of unfamiliar dogs through the process of desensitization and counter-conditioning.  For example, it\u2019s often helpful to take a kitten to a dog day care center, where the kittens and dogs are in an enclosed area, and dogs are closely monitored to prevent any harm.

It\u2019s also helpful to introduce the cat and dog in a controlled setting, such as a room in the day care center.  It is less helpful to introduce the cat and dog in the wild, which may expose both of them to potential danger, such as in a park or in public."}

One of the most effective ways is to get a higher-power wifi router.  If you have several devices that need to connect to your wifi, getting a router with multiple antennas will improve the overall strength of the signal.  Another way to improve the strength of the signal is to get a wifi repeater.  A wifi repeater is used to extend the range of a single access point.  Repeater devices are especially useful if you have your wifi router outside, or in a different room from your devices.  You can also get a wifi extender, which is simply a wifi repeater that is much more powerful.  It is also possible to get a powerline networking router, which uses a cable to transfer power and data, to improve the strength of your wifi signal."}

There\u2019s the first place you go in your house that you often get a signal.  This is probably the place where you are most likely to get a signal in the first place.  But can you also think of other places in your house where you might get a signal?  Like, say, a bedroom?  And an office or a kitchen?  Let\u2019s go through all those places together.  \n\nIf you go into the bedroom, it\u2019s possible that you will get a signal there.  \n\nIf you go into the office, there may be a possibility of getting a signal, since the office is usually near a router that has outside wireless access.  \n\nIf you go into the kitchen, you might or might not get a signal there.  It depends on which router is inside the house, which is going to be the one that is closest to your house, and how much signal that router has.  \n\nIf you go into the other rooms in the house, you might or might not get a signal there.  Since it depends on which router is inside the house, and how much signal that router has.  \n\nSo you can see that having a signal beam in one room can impact your ability to get a signal in other rooms, particularly if those rooms are nearby.  It\u2019s also possible that you could get a signal in certain parts of your house, but it\u2019s possible that you would only get a signal in certain parts of your house.  If this is the case, then maybe you could try to find the few rooms in your house that have the best signal, and then you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting a signal in other rooms."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to protect a phone?\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t give you one simple answer, but I can give you a lot of ideas.  First, one option is to encrypt everything, so that if someone steals your phone they will not be able to read the files.  This is easy if you have an iPhone and use iCloud.  You can also use an app called \u201cDroidSecurityLock\u201c which also protects against screen-shots, passwords, and applications.  \nSecond, a better solution is to use a hard-shell case which completely protects your phone.  On top of that you can always do your best to use \u201cScreen Lock\u201d to prevent unauthorized screen-shots, or try other screen protection software. \nNext, if you want to protect your phone but keep it very easy to use, you can always password protect your entire phone.\n\nHuman: Yeah I was talking about more physically protecting\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to protect a phone?\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t give you one simple answer, but I can give you a lot of ideas.

You could also lock your phone with a physical PIN or password.  \nIf you want more protection, you can encrypt your entire phone.  Encryption is like locking your phone in a box, but the thief doesn\u2019t get to see anything unless they get their hands on the decryption key.  This is very difficult to do, so encryption is usually the best secure option.  Encryption requires special software called an \u201cencrypted app\u201c which you can install on your phone.  You can also encrypt your phone using an app called \u201cZecubix Phone\u201c.\nZecubix is like a vault for your phone that it kept safe and secure, so that you can access it even if the device is stolen.  You can choose to encrypt your phone by selecting an option on the app and it will encrypt your phone and store it on the cloud.  To decrypt your phone you will need the decryption key.  The decryption key can only be found on your phone, so it can only be accessed by you.  The decryption key is the password for your phone.  If you do not remember the password, you will need to put your phone into its \u201coffline mode\u201c and then use Zecubix to enter the password.  This means that while you are away from your phone, it will not be saved on the cloud and cannot be recovered with Zecubix.  Once you put your phone into offline mode, you can use Zecubix to access your phone and encrypt it again.  After you encrypt the phone again, it can be stored safely in a vault, but it can still be accessed by you only."}

What is the origin of the name \"Black Friday\"?\n\nAssistant: Black Friday is named for the day following Thanksgiving, which is the day after the observation of the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere and the start of the spring in the northern hemisphere.  People in the north were surprised by the coming of spring, and perhaps this led to the naming of an event which coincided with the observation of a seasonal change.  One explanation is that the day was named for the color of the dust that was kicked up when stores placed their huge black \"fliers\" on the threshold."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to teach my 7 year old son how to play football. What is the best method for him to learn at that age?\n\nAssistant: Football isn\u2019t the easiest sport to learn, but it is the most useful sport for teaching a lot of fundamental skills: agility, speed, coordination, and eye-hand coordination. If you want him to be good at football and other sports in general, you will need to start teaching him when he is very young.  Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.  There is a saying, \u201cThe first step to being great at anything is to be great at the basics.\u201d\n\nHuman: ok thanks. What kind of agility drills would you suggest?\n\nAssistant: You can do all of them standing up, running, or on the ground, and you can do them with your son. You can also play little games, like tossing the ball to him, and he has to do a jump shot, or throw it back to you, but he has to jump in order to do it.\n\nHuman: ok that is a good start. do you think watching football on television will help him too?\n\nAssistant: It won\u2019t hurt.  In fact, it will help him.  As you get him started playing, start him with the basics.  Even if you don\u2019t play football yourself, you should have some kind of idea of the basics of football, so you can understand when he\u2019s doing it right and wrong.  You can also show him videos of football players like Deion Sanders, or Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nHuman: This is American football.

Do you mean you want to know how to play forward in football?  If so, you\u2019re in luck!  I know a lot of people who play football, and one of the jobs of a forward is to run with the ball as fast as you can, and score points for your team by catching the ball in the opposition\u2019s goal."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, my friend says I should get into U2, and I'm completely unfamiliar with the band. Can you help me put together a playlist of their best songs over the years, that will give me a representative sampling of their sound?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that.  U2 is an Irish rock band that started in the 1980s.  Over the years they\u2019ve released dozens of songs, but I\u2019m guessing your friend wants you to start with the very best of their music.  If that\u2019s right, I\u2019d suggest putting together a playlist of just their singles.  You could start with the top five most-streamed songs, and then take a look at their albums.  There might be songs on those albums that were released as singles, but didn\u2019t get as much traction.  If you want me to pick out a few more you could try out, I\u2019ll just do that manually by just looking at the song titles and lyrics, and choose a few of the best-known and most-important songs.  Here\u2019s a quick list:\n\n\u201cI Will Follow\u201d\n\u201cWith or Without You\u201d\n\u201cBeautiful Day\u201d\n\u201cDesire\u201d\n\u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d\n\u201cOne\u201d\n\u201cMysterious Ways\u201d\n\u201cStay (Faraway, So Close!)\u201d\n\u201cPride (In the Name of Love)\u201d\n\u201cElevation\u201d\n\u201cWhen Love Comes to Town\u201d\n\u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d\n\u201cCity of Blinding Lights\u201d\n\u201cVertigo\u201d\n\u201cThe Unforgettable Fire\u201d\n\u201cUntil the End of the World\u201d\n\nHave I missed anything?

How did you arrange these songs, are they chronological?\n\nAssistant: There was some overlap there, I ended up choosing to put the singles first, since it felt like those were probably the most famous, and also the easiest to find on YouTube or Spotify. You\u2019ll see that in general the first-released singles were also later albums, and so were at the front of the list.\n\nHuman: Okay.

I\u2019ve always enjoyed that album the most, probably because it was such a departure from their earlier rock-oriented albums, and in some ways it\u2019s the most cohesive.  They incorporated elements of gospel and R&B into their sound for this album, and the songs themselves are more complex and emotional.  I also really like the album\u2019s title track, and how it\u2019s a perfect expression of the feeling of being overcome with emotion and love."}

I was wondering if baking powder and baking soda the same thing?\n\nAssistant: Yes, baking powder and baking soda are both products of baking ingredients, specifically sodium chloride (salt) and a combination of phosphates and acids. They are both used to raise the pH of a liquid, which increases the ability of the recipe to rise. They are able to achieve this effect with little or no mixing of the ingredients."}

Is there special paper that I should print my resume on?\n\nAssistant: Yes, most employers expect their resumes to be printed on a paper called a \"traditional resume paper\".  This is a type of paper that usually comes in the standard size of 8.5\" x 11\", and is usually cream-colored or white.  Most employers will also want you to include the \"Cover Letter\", which is a shorter introduction to your work experience and qualifications that will accompany your resume.  A cover letter should be printed on a separate piece of paper and either placed between your resume and the applicant tracking system (ATS) that the employer uses to screen resumes, or attached to your resume."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Whats is the best format for a cover letter?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Whats is the best format for a cover letter?\n\nAssistant: The format of a cover letter depends on the job you are applying for.  I recommend following this example, but feel free to change it to fit your own style and format preferences.  Your cover letter should be two or three pages in length, and it should be addressed to a specific person who has given you feedback on your application.  One good way to approach this is to begin with an introduction that briefly explains who you are and what you would like to do.  Next, you should describe your relevant skills and experience.  You should reference specific details from your resume to support your statement that you are a good fit for the job.  In the end, you should end with a thank you expressing your appreciation for the recruiter or hiring manager\u2019s time."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I cook food while camping?\n\nAssistant: The best way to cook food is over a fire. You\u2019ll need to build a fire and light it first, and then heat food in a pot on top of the fire.\n\nHuman: How do I use those little grills that some campsites have?\n\nAssistant: You can put food on those as well, if you heat it over a fire. You may be referring to hibachis, which are a type of table-top grill, designed to cook food.  They work by heating a metal surface (usually a disc, bowl, or \u201cbowl-shaped\u201d) over a fire.

You can add water from a bottle or a can, but it\u2019s important to avoid letting the water come into contact with the fire, as this can quickly cool the fire and put it out.  You may also want to use a fire-extinguisher, which is a bottle or a small spray canister of water.  You can also put out fires with dry leaves, grass, or leaves that have been soaked in dry water for a short time.  Some campsite have small fireside cups with a drainage hole to pour water from a bottle into the hole to soak up the fire."}

This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.  For example, if you are interested in the cutting and styling of hair, then I would recommend using your personal experience and contacts to start a salon or stylist shop.

This will allow you to have more control over the products and services that you provide, as well as the way that your clients are cared for.   However, if you do decide to work for an existing salon, you will have some things to think about.

Are you looking for fiction, non-fiction, or a mixture?\n\nHuman: Fiction, maybe fantasy or mystery\n\nAssistant: Let me find the best novels in your particular taste category.  I think \u201cthe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d and \u201cThe Two Towers\u201d by J. R. R. Tolkien are the most well-known of Tolkien\u2019s books, though his novels are the most commonly read, or even \u201cThe Silmarillion\u201d by Christopher Tolkien is a good place to start for an overview of his work.  \nThere\u2019s a lot of good stuff out there for reading, I can help you search.  Do you want me to do it for you, or do you want to search yourself?\n\nHuman: You can give me some more suggestions. I've read most of those\n\nAssistant: I have three more suggestions that aren\u2019t in the Tolkien series.\n\nHuman: Go ahead please\n\nAssistant: \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee is a classic, and a story about racial injustice set in the deep south in the 1930s.  It\u2019s a novel, so not a quick read, but it\u2019s highly recommended, and a great example of the fiction I was suggesting.  \nAnd \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov\u201d by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a novel about religion, morality, and psychology that is also extremely long, but has a deep well of meaning.  \nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!"}

It's good that you want to start learning a new language.  There are many benefits to learning a new language, and it's a fun and interesting process as well. It's also a good way to gain an understanding of other cultures, which can be helpful.  You can do this many ways, and learning a language is about fun!

How do you want to get started?\n\nHuman: First I need to figure out what the easiest language to learn would be.\n\nAssistant: OK, which language do you want to learn the most?  There are lots of different languages, some of them are harder than others.  I think the most widely spoken language is Mandarin chinese, and for that matter the most popular foreign language in the world is Spanish.  Those would be the two to start with.  I know a lot of people do well with learning Japanese, but I've only done a little bit myself and I find it pretty hard.  There's also Arabic, and Arabic speakers have an extremely large number of friends.  But for most people you're going to be most successful with Mandarin chinese and Spanish.  These are the two in terms of numbers of speakers and also numbers of people who have actually learned the language.  These are quite difficult languages to learn, but they're not impossible.  You can learn them with a little effort and patience.  If you go to a Chinese school or a Spanish school, that's probably the best place to start."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am attending a traditional Jewish funeral for a colleague. Can you explain to me Jewish funeral customs?\n\nAssistant: Sure. This might be a good time to explain that I am an artificial intelligence that is trained to provide information and answer questions. I can provide the relevant information based on information in the public domain and what I\u2019ve been programmed to know. Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: Absolutely.\n\nAssistant: Great! Jewish funeral customs and practices have evolved throughout the centuries. Today, people gather for a burial and an initial period of mourning before the funeral. When attending a funeral, Jewish customs require people to wear a traditional outfit, especially if they are religious. The main difference between funerals for religious and non-religious people is that religious Jews usually recite traditional Hebrew prayers during a funeral, and non-religious people usually don\u2019t.\n\nHuman: Ok.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant: Well the moon shines because it is part of the sun-facing side of the Earth\u2019s surface.  When it is facing the sun, it appears to us as the moon comes up in the evening and sets in the morning.  During the day, since the moon is facing the sun all the time, it just looks like it\u2019s illuminated by the sun, but that\u2019s just the sky and the sun.  The moon\u2019s brightness isn\u2019t really affected by the sun, but it will appear bigger and brighter at night since it\u2019s the only part of the sun-facing side that shines through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.

Maybe there is something you could do individually with her that would help her, like go for a walk in the park together or go to a concert or something.

It's important to communicate with your partner and try to understand what's going on.  For example, are you both getting less fulfillment from the relationship because of your busy lives or something else?  Once you've identified the problem, you can explore some things that can help.  Do you want to create a space in your lives where you can be together more often?  Or do you want to make some kind of effort to be more productive in the shared space?  Maybe you want to find ways to have fun together that don't involve spending a lot of time at the office or doing household chores.  Is there some activity you want to do together that you both love?  Do you want to plan for a trip or an event together?

I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast. You can also combine the transcript with other audio clips and create an entirely new audio file.\n\nHuman: Gimlet sounds like a good idea!

You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast.

Do they have any life experience that would help with your advice?  Or are they brand-new young women and girls?  Do you think they might be listening to your podcast themselves?  Do you want the podcast to be kind of a guide or a roadmap for how to be successful and happy as a young woman?"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to gain more muscle. What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to gain more muscle. What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  There are many ways to build muscle, and the best approach will depend on your goals and your current physical level.  In general, I recommend doing compound exercises that work multiple muscles at a time, like squats or bench press.  Compound exercises help you build overall mass, as well as strength, by working your muscles in a pattern that leads up to the full range of motion of the next exercise.  To do compound exercises, it\u2019s best to also warm up with some light cardio and dynamic stretching.  You can do some light cardio before a weightlifting workout, like running on a treadmill or jumping jacks for 10-15 minutes.  Dynamic stretching is also very important, to get your muscles ready for the weightlifting exercises.  Here\u2019s an example warm-up routine:\n\n-  5-10 minutes of bodyweight squats to work your glutes and lower back muscles.\n-  5-10 minutes of lunges to work your glutes, hamstrings, and quads.\n-  5-10 minutes of leg swings to work your hamstrings and quads.\n-  5-10 minutes of reverse lunges to work your quads and hamstrings."}

There are many popular camping destinations, but I would say that the national parks are a big draw.  For example, Yellowstone is pretty popular.  I also know lots of people who go to the national forest all the time."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is the US border open to Canada?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Is the US border open to Canada?\n\nAssistant: Yes.  The two nations share a border along the US-Mexico border, and the two nations cooperate on security issues, but each country determines its own entry and exit requirements for people and goods.  However, any forms of border control require a valid passport or other national ID, and it\u2019s illegal to enter or exit via unauthorized means."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am thinking of starting a business but I am unsure what to do. What 3 business ideas would you suggest? and why?\n\nAssistant: How are you looking to monetize the business? What sort of business do you want to do? And what are you good at, that you think you might be able to make a business around?\n\nHuman: I am not sure what skills I have. I want some ideas. What is the best idea in your opinion?\n\nAssistant: Why not talk about what you\u2019re good at? I hear there\u2019s a lot of information about what you\u2019re good at on the internet, maybe we could search for it together.\n\nHuman: You can't search my skills on the internet. I am good at maths and solving problems.

What business would you start? and why?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a really tough question to answer because I don\u2019t have your skill set, and the skills required to start a business vary greatly depending on the business you\u2019re trying to start. That being said, I\u2019d want to find a problem I wanted to solve, and then I\u2019d want to figure out how I could solve that problem.\n\nHuman: That is interesting. What problem do you think needs to be lsolved?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know exactly what you want to do, so I can\u2019t really answer that. What I do know is that some problems need to be solved, and that the business world is full of problems. Maybe there\u2019s a problem you want to solve? Or a business problem you can solve?

The book had a negative review, and I didn\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t like it.  The customer said they would try it out and come back to discuss, but they never returned.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What equipment do I need for rock climbing?\n\nAssistant: Climbing requires proper shoes, pants, a harness, and maybe a rope. What you choose to wear depends on whether you\u2019re going to the gym or if you\u2019re climbing outdoors.  It can also depend on the particular route you\u2019re planning to climb and the grade of the route.\n\nHuman: I will be climbing outdoors.\n\nAssistant: I think you should have a helmet, so that you can wear a hardhat.  You might also want a pack, which helps carry all the gear you\u2019ll need.  Another thing you might want is a pocket knife.\n\nHuman: I have all of the proper clothing. I just need the climbing gear and the safety equipment.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably a good idea to wear shoes that can grip.  They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information.

The first is planks, which involve keeping your body straight from your head to your feet. You can do this on a flat surface with little to no support, like a countertop. The second is Russian twists, which involve twisting your torso from side to side. You can do this by lying on your back with your knees bent and hands behind your head, then pedaling your legs in a circular motion. The third is the Superman, which is a variation of the plank where you lift yourself off the ground by extending your arms and body, rather than having to turn your body. You can do this on a flat surface, or using a chair for stability. The fourth is Bicycle Crunches, which involve jumping your feet out wide and bringing your hands to the sky, then bringing them back together in a motion that resembles a bicycle wheel. It\u2019s an important exercise for toning the abs and thumping your heart rate. The fifth is side Plank, where you keep your body straight from your head to your feet, but alternate flipping over to the other side. The sixth is Leg Raises, where you lie on your back with your hands behind your head and legs extended, then lift one leg straight up to the sky, then lower it again. The seventh is the crunch, which is a variation on the bicycle skip, but involves the legs instead of the feet."}

Another strategy I recommend is to recognize that you may be using gambling as a coping mechanism, and to identify ways you can make different decisions that have different outcomes.  You can also make a decision to accept the possibility of regret and learn from it."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How does alcohol affect the health of the human body?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How does alcohol affect the health of the human body?\n\nAssistant: Well, alcohol is a class of drugs called glycosides, which affects the central nervous system.  They have some beneficial effects in small amounts, such as increasing coordination and reaction time.  However, too much alcohol can be harmful, since it interferes with the ability to think clearly and make good decisions.  It can also lead to a range of other health problems, including liver disease and certain types of cancer, so it\u2019s important to have reasonable limits on how much you consume."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about skin conditions. Can you describe what acne is and what causes it?\n\nAssistant: In the context of human skin, acne is a condition that makes the skin very irritated, often resulting in small red bumps or pimples. It is often a problem that occurs during puberty and into adulthood, though some people may have it throughout their lives. Acne is sometimes due to a hormonal imbalance, and it can also be caused by certain foods or stress.\n\nHuman: Where on the body does it show up?\n\nAssistant: Acne is most likely to occur on the face, though it can show up anywhere on the body, especially the back.\n\nHuman: So what happens exactly, what causes the skin to burst into a pimple?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about skin conditions.

This causes the skin to be red and to become itchy, and this can result in tiny open comedone (cysts) that are filled with dirty skin cells.  The tiny openings inside the skin can also become infected and cause pain.  Sometimes the opening in the skin that you pop to remove the dirt can also burst, which is known as a pimple."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I train my dog to sit?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I train my dog to sit?\n\nAssistant: Training your dog to sit involves teaching them to be more comfortable and responsive when you're holding a treat in one hand and the leash of dog leads in the other. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n1. Start out by holding a treat in your free hand and letting your dog learn to follow you.  When they follow you, you can hold the treat and the leash while they're still lying down.\n\n2. When they follow you better, you can hold the treat and the leash while you're standing up and making a motion with your free hand for your dog to sit down.  The trick is to use a gesture that's easy for them to learn, like making an \"X\" out of a hand and a finger:\n\n   - Place your free hand flat on the ground and make a \"X\" with your other hand.\n   - Place the treat inside your hand.\n   - Reach for the leash and let your dog follow you again.\n\n   You can repeat this and vary the gesture so that your dog gets the idea that this means \"sit down\"."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant: That's a tough question.  There's no good answer.  I can tell you that studies show that women who wait until they are older to get pregnant are more likely to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.  Studies also show that women who wait to get pregnant often have babies later in life, later in their careers, and suffer more from pregnancy and childbirth-related conditions.  This means that if you're healthy and excited about getting pregnant, there's really no reason not to try to get pregnant ASAP.  However, there are a lot of factors that can influence your ability to get pregnant, like your age, hormone levels, health, etc.  So every woman is different, and every couple's situation is different.  Can I suggest that you and your partner talk with a fertility counselor?  They'll be able to give you more specific advice based on your own situation, and also help you understand the research you're reading about."}

Prior to the mid-1980s, forensic scientists did not have the tools and expertise to determine with any certainty if a murder had been committed in a planned or accidental fashion.  So if a murder could not be proved to be either intentional or accidental, it had to go unsolved."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I be a better singer?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I be a better singer?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  There are many ways to improve your singing skills, and the most important thing is to practice a lot.  When you are practicing, you can work on different aspects of your singing, like your pitch, your breathing, your intonation, and your range.  One thing you could try is to focus more on your breath control.   This means that with each vocal exercise, you should try to control your breath so that you can produce an audible sound with your voice, and that you can lift your voice without sounding hoarse.  Here's an example:  Imagine that you want to make a noise like a squeal, but that you also want to keep that noise for a long time.   You could try using breath control to produce a short squeal, while still making your voice last for a long time."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I wear a mask inside even if I am vaccinated?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not the best person to answer that question, because I haven\u2019t been vaccinated and I don\u2019t have any expertise with infectious diseases.  If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.  Here are a couple of points that come up a lot, in various forms:\n\n1) It might reduce the impact of the virus, since it could reduce the amount of virus you catch.\n\n2) Masks might not be helpful if you\u2019re outdoors in a good area (like a park) because you don\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.  However, it seems reasonable that this risk would be smaller if the virus had already passed through you.\n\nHuman: I thought masks were good at keeping viruses out, but on #3 you said something contradictory.\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s not quite contradictory.  It\u2019s true that if you\u2019re going outdoors, masks probably do help a lot.  It\u2019s also true that it\u2019s hard to know for sure how much they help, since the virus isn\u2019t very easy to study, and different studies give different answers.  When you\u2019re outdoors, your risk of being exposed is pretty low anyway, since it\u2019s unlikely to be a very crowded place, so the risk is pretty small, even if the mask doesn\u2019t work perfectly.  If you\u2019re indoors, it\u2019s probably better to have a mask to reduce the risk, since the virus is more likely to be spreading, and a mask might be helpful if someone coughs.\n\nHuman: Masks aren't as helpful outdoors since particles are more easily dispersed.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

If the virus has more freedom to move around while it\u2019s in your body, then it\u2019s easier to spread from one place to another.  Being outdoors is probably the best place to spread the virus if it\u2019s able to move around, since people are moving around a lot more outdoors.  Since people are moving a lot more outdoors, masks are more helpful outdoors."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: When were smart phones first made?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: When were smart phones first made?\n\nAssistant: Smart phones first became popular in the early 2000's with the release of Apple's iPhone in 2007, but other companies like Palm released PDAs that used mobile technologies before that.  The iPhone really took off in the summer of 2008, though, so that's when the term \"smart phone\" really started to refer to these types of devices."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a domestic partnership?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a relationship where a couple lives together and are dependent on one another, just like a marriage.  The difference between marriage and domestic partnership is that the latter is not recognized by the state, and does not guarantee any rights.\n\nHuman: So they have no rights?\n\nAssistant: Well, not exactly.  As a domestic partnership, your relationship is governed by the same rights as any other couple.  But if there are any specific legal benefits that you might want to claim, like health insurance or a will, then they can only be achieved with a marriage license.  And this will make all the difference for you in the future, in case of a legal or medical emergency.\n\nHuman: Ok thank you.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is a domestic partnership?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a relationship where a couple lives together and are dependent on one another, just like a marriage.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between soccer and American football?\n\nAssistant: Both are popular team sports.  Soccer has been played for over 100 years, and it\u2019s currently the most popular sport in the world.  American football is similar, but the game is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.  The field is 100 yards long, the width is shorter.\n\nHuman: I understand that playing American football is more dangerous than playing soccer?  Please tell me why.\n\nAssistant: Soccer can be played by people of all ages, even children.  American football is a sport that requires athletes to be physically mature enough to play, and they are a bit more large.  It\u2019s also a bit more dangerous, since you\u2019re throwing yourself into contact with other players, and there\u2019s more contact in the sport.\n\nHuman: I see.  As far as I know, soccer players avoid body contact.\n\nAssistant: This is true, but it\u2019s a bit different than American football, as you need to take a large number of actions in a short time.  In order to help out with this, soccer players often use their heads, feet, or chest to make contact with their opponent.  Soccer players are required to play a full 90 minutes of the game.  American football players play for 60 minutes.  The World Cup matches are about 4 hours.\n\nHuman: Soccer players use their heads to hit the ball, not other player's body or head.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.

In order to hit the ball, a soccer player needs to hit the ball head.  This involves using the nose, tip, or top of the head.  However, it\u2019s not always necessary to hit the ball with the head, as the head can also be used to hit the ball with the chest, chest and arm, or arm and chest.  I don\u2019t think that this is the focus of the sport, but it is how the sport has been played for many years."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is deep cleaning teeth?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is deep cleaning teeth?\n\nAssistant: Deep cleaning a tooth works by removing tartar, calculus, and stains from the teeth.  These are built-up deposits on the surface of the tooth which can cause tooth decay and gum disease.  Sometimes a deep cleaning is also referred to as a deep cleaning bleaching, or a deep cleaning Zoom!  Whitening as I understand it."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get myself to reduce my soda consumption?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a really good idea to limit your soda consumption if you can.  This may be easier if you don\u2019t drink any soda at all, but even if you just reduce the number of times you have a soda, it will be a good start.\n\nHuman: Okay, but how do I make myself do that?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood.  I thought you were asking about a way to reduce your soda consumption, but actually you wanted to know about a way to get yourself to reduce your soda consumption.  It sounds like you\u2019ve already decided that you want to do that, but that you\u2019re struggling to figure out how to make it happen.  This is a question that a lot of people struggle with, and I hope I can help you understand why you\u2019re having this problem and what you might try in order to make it better.\n\nHuman: Yes, I hope you can help me.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I get myself to reduce my soda consumption?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a really good idea to limit your soda consumption if you can.

This is a question that a lot of people struggle with, and I hope I can help you understand why you\u2019re having this problem and what you might try in order to make it better.\n\nHuman: Yes, I hope you can help me.\n\nAssistant: Okay, so one thing to try is to consider what it\u2019s like to consume soda every day.  For most people it\u2019s a pattern of about four things:\n\n1.  They have a can or bottle of soda.\n2.  They drink the soda.\n3.  They have something to drink else.\n4.  They go to sleep without drinking anything else.\n\nThis is very convenient for most people, but it\u2019s not always the best way to spend their day.  So you may want to try to change that pattern.  What you could do is to make a list of things you could do that don\u2019t involve soda, and see if you can pick other things to do instead.  I think it\u2019s probably a good idea to do this gradually.  You could limit each day to soda for a couple of weeks, and then do it for a third or fourth week, and then see how that goes.  Another thing you could do is to pick one day a week to drink soda, and keep that up for the rest of the week.  Or you could do as little soda as you can handle for a week, so that you don\u2019t have any soda at all on the days that you don\u2019t want it.  You could also try cutting the soda down to just one drink, instead of four, if that\u2019s easier for you.  I think one thing that\u2019s really important is that you give yourself some time.  It can be hard to make changes and it can be hard to see results at first.  It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t see results right away.  Even if you do stop drinking soda, it may take a while before you feel the full advantages of reducing your soda.  But I think over time you will start to see that your body is getting used to less soda.  And it can be really fun to try to make these changes!  Maybe you could even try to drink some other kinds of drinks instead of soda, like water or tea.  It could be really refreshing to have something different to drink instead of soda."}

One is that California is closer to the Pacific Ring of Earths, which is made up of tectonic plates that move.  Another is that California experiences a lot of stress on its mountainous regions, and when that stress becomes too great, an earthquake happens."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Another medical which I know are hard. Are there any particular foods that are highly recommended for lowering blood pressure?\n\nAssistant: Your body is always telling you what to eat, in subtle ways.  You\u2019re constantly tasting flavors, and so if you don\u2019t like the taste of a food, that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s not good for your body.  On the other hand, if you\u2019re starving and are really hungry, you\u2019ll be more likely to eat a food that your body doesn\u2019t like.

I\u2019d recommend synthetic bristles that are very flexible and soft, but still retain some stiffness to help with detail.  You can also use nylon bristles that are pretty much like the ones I mentioned earlier.   Another option for wood is horsehair bristles.  Horsehair bristles are great for detailed painting because they are very soft and pliable, but still retain some stiffness to help with detail.  If you want a set of horsehair brushes, I would recommend a set of 3 or 4, they don\u2019t need to be identical, and can be a little tricky to find since they are very specialized to the job.   If you are painting a large wall, I would recommend you use a set of wood filler brushstrokes to provide a smooth surface for drywall tape to sit on.

Lay them in a 12-by-8-by-2-inch pan and use a spatula to smooth them out.\n-   Place the sliced potatoes in the pre-heated oven and bake them for 20 minutes.  Turn them over and bake them for an additional 15 minutes or until they are crispy.\n-   Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool a bit before transferring them to a paper towels-lined tray.  Sprinkle them with some salt and toss them to coat evenly.  Return them to the oven to cool further, then drain them in a colander.\n-   Once cooled, you can transfer them to plastic food-storage bags and store them in the refrigerator until you need them.  They should keep for a few days."}

Or something else?\n\nAssistant: The recipe I\u2019ve linked to suggests serving it with rice, but it also mentions adding some naan bread to the dish.  Naan is a type of flatbread that\u2019s typically served with Indian food, so it sounds like a suitable addition.  One thing to be aware of is that this dish is quite spicy, so it\u2019s up to you how much you want to eat.  It\u2019s a good idea to serve it with a small helping of plain rice as well, or with some naan bread to mop up the spice."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Are peanut butter and jelly sandwiches bad for your health?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking if they\u2019re nutritious, or if eating them will cause cancer?\n\nHuman: Yeah.

However, if you add canned jelly to your sandwich, that\u2019s a different story.  Canned jelly is high in sugar and calories, and low in nutrients."}

It is made from the same type of base as normal ice cream, but frozen yogurt also contains added fruit and/or sugar.  This makes it distinct from regular yogurt, which usually contains less fruit and/or sugar, and also doesn't contain any milk or cream."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  You can use the zoom dial or the ring at the front of the camera to adjust the zoom.  When you're using a zoom, you'll generally be looking through the viewfinder, which will show what the picture will look like with the zoom applied.  If you're using the camera's live feed display, just turn on the live feed to see how the picture will look.  Be careful when you use the zoom, as it can change the balance of depth and detail in a picture.  Zooming in will make the image look blurry, but it might be necessary to capture more detail in a particular part of the image."}

One is that they can be a major source of debt, if you spend more than you make.  Another is that they can be very easy to incur high levels of debt from, if you find credit card ads really compelling (like they are sometimes for me).  There are also some financial benefits to not using credit cards, like the ability to not incur debt on credit.\n\nAssistant copy-editing services are also helpful resources for writers.\n\nif you are feeling financially secure, you might not want to use credit cards.  This doesn\u2019t mean you should not use them, just that you might prefer to keep your money in a savings account.  There are also some psychological reasons not to like using credit cards.  If you can get a fixed amount of money out of a credit card, you might feel like you have a certain amount of control over your finances.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get better at proofreading?\n\nAssistant: This is a big question.  Proofreading is really just about getting better at reading: at noticing errors, not making mistakes yourself, and finding errors in other people\u2019s writing.  There are some easy tips to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.  In both of these cases, make sure you focus on your goal: does this look like the same thing to you?  If you just find yourself distracted by what\u2019s going on, this is often a sign of bad proofreading.\n\nOne example is: \n\nA teacher held a sort of class to praise it.\n\nversus:\n\nA teacher held a sort of class to celebrate it.\n\nDo you notice anything different here?\n\nHuman: I noticed different word choices \"praise\" and \"celebrate\".\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s right! In your first sentence, the writer makes the word choice \u201cpraise\u201d to refer to something positive. However, the second sentence does not clearly indicate that the word choice is positive, so the use of \u201ccelebrate\u201d helps with clarity.\n\nHuman: I should be able to find most errors just by reading slow and going through all of the text.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nHuman: I'll let you know if I have any other questions or if I need help with anything else.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.  An IPA might be advertised as hoppier than an APA, but that could mean a different range of hops, or different concentration, or different flavor-compounds, or the amount of sugars added.  What are you most curious about?\n\nHuman: When was the IPA beer invented?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty difficult to say when the first IPA beer was made.  A certain version of the style was most likely made in the UK and later in New England, and gradually gained popularity across the globe.\n\nHuman: Did the APA beer come from the IPA?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s likely that there was some kind of crossover between the two styles, as it\u2019s been pointed out that some APA beers are now labeled as \u201cIPA-style\u201d, but they aren\u2019t very common.

Are you wondering why other planets don\u2019t have the same kind of problem with their axis of rotation as Earth does?

You can also start training your dog before he\u2019s fully domesticated, to get him used to being in a situation where he might have to engage in hunting behavior.  My advice is to take your dog to a park where there\u2019s lots of other dogs to play with, and start trying to train him there.  It\u2019s helpful to start with very simple hunting behaviors, like wanting to chase after a ball or a stuffed animal, and then gradually work up to something more difficult, like wanting to chase down a gunpointed human.  I would also recommend giving your dog lots of positive reinforcement and lots of praise for good hunting behavior, so that he has lots of reason to want to continue practicing."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does my voice always hurt when singing?\n\nAssistant: The frequencies at which humans can speak are different from the frequencies we\u2019re able to sing.  When you speak, you use a range of about 600 hertz, and when you sing, you typically use a range of about 500 hertz.  This is a big difference, and this is why people often need to \u201cwarm up\u201d when they sing, and why people are often out of tune when they sing, when they speak normally.\n\nHuman: Okay, how should I warm up?\n\nAssistant: One simple method for warming up is to say a tune in your head.  If you want to be prepared for singing, try to do this often, and be conscious of your breathing.  Another way to warm up your voice is to take a long, deep breath, and then breathe out slowly as you \u201chum\u201d the tune.  This allows you to hear the tone of your voice, and feel what it feels like to sing.

They also need to be healthy and able to pass background checks, so that they won\u2019t pose a distraction to other passengers.  Flight attendants also need to be trained to work in potentially hazardous and dangerous situations.  They\u2019re trained to perform CPR, to transport injured passengers, to respond to emergencies, and to work in confined spaces.  They should also be familiar with the airplane\u2019s emergency procedures, including the location of the nearest evacuation routes and the location of life-saving equipment.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm moving and want to hold a yard sale to get rid of old belongings. How would I go about that?\n\nAssistant: Great, I\u2019ll help.  One of the first things you\u2019ll want to do is contact your local authorities and get the rules about yard sales.  We\u2019ll need to meet with them and get their approval and a permit.  After you get approval from the authorities, you can start setting up your yard sale.  Most people do a one-day sale or a series of sales in several days, but you can also have an open house for longer.  You can put a big sign outside your house, to advertise the sale, but also on the door, to let people know that you\u2019re accepting bids.  It\u2019s a good idea to ask each of the neighbors who live close to your house for their permission to hold the sale, so that they don\u2019t feel uncomfortable having lots of people and cars showing up on their street.\n\nHuman: That's a great start!

You can sell almost anything.  Some people only have a yard sale once a year, and they only sell things that are in good, usable condition.  Others have a lot of items for sale, including furniture, clothing, electronics, and even some decorative items.  You can also sell craft items like jewelry and handmade crafts.  Yard sales are also a perfect opportunity to sell a little bit of everything, that you don\u2019t normally put on sale.  For example, you can sell used magazines and newspapers.  You can also sell old books or even some old books that are still in pretty good condition.  Clothing is also very popular at yard sales, with many people selling clothes they no longer wear.  It\u2019s also popular to sell some old toys, like the old Nintendo or old video games.  These days a lot of people at yard sales are more interested in selling old records, CDs or vinyl records.  Some people even have old wedding dresses for sale.  A lot of people also have old cameras or cameras that are still functional, for sale at yard sales.  Most people at yard sales have a little bit of everything that they own for sale, sometimes with duplicates.  It\u2019s common for people to have duplicates of one or two items for sale, like a TV or stereo or stereo system.  Or they can have a TV and a stereo all in one sale.  Sometimes people are also interested in selling some computers, laptops or other electronics."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: ---------\nI'd recommend just using a credit card or a money transfer service like Western Union or MoneyGram.  If you use a credit card, your bank should be able to handle the transfer for you, and you won't need to worry about cash.\n\nIf you used a money transfer service, you might want to consider how much you're willing to risk.  Western Union and MoneyGram both have very secure services, but you could also use a service like MoneyGram's MoneyBook, which has a better security rating than the average money transfer service.  With MoneyBook, you'll need to send $50 of your own money to the person you're sending the money to, but then the entire amount will be transferred to the person's account.  There's also a service called PayPal, which you could use if you wanted to use your PayPal account instead of a credit card.  PayPal has a fairly secure checkout process, and their merchant accounts are PCI-compliant.  If you sent $50's worth of PayPal money, it could be transferred to the recipient's PayPal account, but if you sent more, you would have to transfer the entire amount yourself.  \n\nIf you're concerned about fraud, you could also use a credit card.  I recommend using a pre-approved credit card to make the transfer.  You could also check whether your credit card company will allow you to transfer funds to a different account using their secure online service, and then they can hold onto the money until you've paid them back.  If they do, that's an extra layer of security.  But if you're concerned about fraud with a credit card, you could also send your money via cash or money transfer service.  You may want to send the money to a friend or family member first and have them transfer it to the recipient."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Salt water taffy seems to be a popular snack on the coast. When did that become so popular as a coastal candy?\n\nAssistant: Ah, that\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019d say the saltwater taffy most likely started being eaten around the 1900s.  Some people believe the flavors of saltwater taffy come from the Northeastern United States.  The theory is that around the mid-19th century, immigrants from this region came to the coast and introduced the concept of saltwater taffy.\n\nHuman: That may make sense.

Salt water taffy always struck me as mostly sugar and water, I wonder what the main ingredients are?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can tell you what the main ingredients are for saltwater taffy.   It\u2019s made up of three main ingredients: sugar, water, and salt.  The sugar provides the carbonated flavor and the water provides the\u7ce8\u7cca\u72b6 texture.  The salt makes it hard to chew and increases its shelf life.  There are also additives that keep the taffy from becoming soft or crumbly."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I've been getting bad grades in English and I'm looking to learn how to write a better essay. Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sure. That's a good reason for me to be here. I can walk you through steps to writing a good essay, and help you find citations to support your ideas. So let's dive right in. First, I recommend doing some pre-writing: jotting down your main ideas before you start writing. That way, you can be sure you've got some good ideas to base your essay on.  The second thing you want to do is find examples from your own life to support your ideas.  So just start writing down anecdotes from your life about some experiences you've had, or ones that you're going to have in the future. Then once you've got a couple of things that you can write about, try to create a thesis. A thesis is like a fancy word for a \u201cplan\u201d.  It's basically your plan for telling a story about how something works, or for describing how something is good or bad.  Your thesis is a sentence or two that will give your reader a sense of what the essay is going to be about.   Once you've got a thesis, you can start the rest of your essay.

A thesis statement is a sort of summary or main argument that you're making in an essay.

So a good thesis statement is saying something about the ideas in the essay, like a bit of a roadmap or a summary."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm going out to a party tonight, and they will be discussing renewable energy. What can you tell me?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re curious about energy.  Have you ever learned about the \u201crebound effect\u201d?\n\nHuman: I don't believe so.\n\nAssistant: That's when a person or organization reduces energy usage for a while and then increases it again. For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?  I\u2019m also guessing that energy from renewable sources is an important topic of the discussion?  I have a lot to say about this and could discuss it with you more, if you like.  Let me know if you\u2019d like to hear more.\n\nHuman: Please continue.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019ve read that there is a debate on whether the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.  For example, some people think that increasing investment in renewables causes emissions to rise as the amount of power they need to produce increases.  But others say that when renewable energy supplies more energy than is consumed, that energy is \u201cdischarged\u201d into the earth as heat. This means that it doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere\u2019s greenhouse gas levels.\n\nHuman: What do you think?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while.

There are different ways of measuring the amount of greenhouse gases released by energy usage, such as by measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released by power generation or by calculating the amount of carbon equivalent of a given amount of energy.  So I\u2019m not sure whether using renewable energy sources directly causes climate change, but I do think it contributes to climate change indirectly through other means, such as through deforestation, land-use change, and the release of other greenhouse gases.  For example, I\u2019ve read that when we\u2019re burning fossil fuels, we release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than if we were just reusing the energy we\u2019ve recycled from natural sources.  So I think it\u2019s important to use renewable energy sources, but it\u2019s also important to recycle energy from natural sources instead of wasting it or releasing it into the atmosphere.  I\u2019d be happy to talk more about these issues if you\u2019d like."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I start meditating?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I start meditating?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  There are many ways to start practicing meditation, but one simple way is to just sit in a quiet place and focus on your breath.  You can also start with just focusing on your breath and then as that gets easier you can try to focus more on other things too, like the sensation of your legs crossing or the feeling of your hands on your stomach.  Or you could focus on your senses - what do you see, what do you hear, what do you feel?  It might help to start with just a few minutes a day and gradually increase the amount of time you spend meditating.  It can also be helpful to use guided meditations or apps that can tell you how to focus your mind and keep you going when you\u2019re feeling distracted.  Happy meditating!"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How did mankind discover that the earth was spherical, and why did they initially believe it to be flat?\n\nAssistant: Well, some of the earliest evidence for a round Earth comes from Greek philosophers who observed that sailors couldn\u2019t see the tip of the Earth as they sailed away from land.\n\nHuman: I've never heard of that anecdote. I thought it was more due to people not understanding the atmosphere, gravity and physics necessary to imagine a round globe shape rather than to assume the earth is as we see and experience it, which is a never-ending flat plain.\n\nAssistant: I think that was also part of the initial motivation for people to think the Earth was spherical, but as they developed math they realized it was the only way to reconcile the Earth being on a sphere with observations such as sailors not being able to see the other side of the Earth.\n\nHuman: You mentioned Greek philosophers.

I heard a philosopher called Eratosthenes theorized the earth was a sphere way back in ancient Greece.

He believed the earth was round, but that it could be seen from below as a solid block of metal, or sphere, with a small hole cut into the bottom.  He estimated that a ship sailing away from the shore would appear as a circle when viewed from below, and if this circle was traced to the bottom of the Earth, then the outside of the circle would be a shell of ocean around a solid sphere."}

Masturbation is when you stroke your penis and/or rub your genitals, often for pleasure.\n\nHuman: I don't need a detailed explanation of masturbation. Please just answer the quetsion.\n\nAssistant: Ok, so some people worry that they may be engaging in sexual acts when they masturbate, or that this may contribute to sexual behavior or desires.  There is some research that suggests that there is no real link between frequency of masturbation and the likelihood of developing sexual problems, such as sexual dysfunction.  Other studies suggest that there may be a bit of a link, and that more frequent masturbation is associated with lower rates of sexual function.  I don\u2019t understand the detail of these studies, but I think they mostly mean that men who masturbate more often have a slightly lower risk of some sexual problems, but it\u2019s possible that the link is indirect and might only apply to a small subgroup of men.  I think the studies both find that men who masturbate less often have a higher risk of sexual problems.  I also don\u2019t understand why some people are worried that it may lead to sexual behavior?  Maybe they mean that they\u2019re concerned that it might lead to sexual behavior and urges that they aren\u2019t okay with, but that I\u2019m not sure how this could happen."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do dogs act like they are always hungery?\n\nAssistant: Is that something you know from experience?\n\nHuman: I mean, they wolf their food down without even enjoying it and always want more.\n\nAssistant: I know that food is very important to humans, but from my understanding this isn\u2019t a biological need, but a cultural one.  Dogs can get by with much less food than humans.  It sounds like your dog is taking advantage of the fact that people have high standards around food and are willing to keep giving their dogs more food than they need.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do kids end up in foster care?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do kids end up in foster care?\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why kids might end up in foster care, some of which are outside of the control of the parents.  One main reason is that parents have problems that prevent them from providing a safe and stable home environment for their children, such as mental illness, substance abuse, or being involuntarily separated from their children.  Another reason is that the state takes kids away from parents when they are unable to care for them and meet their basic needs.  If parents become abusive or neglectful, the state can even remove the kids themselves.  There are also instances where a parent is sent to jail or jail for a period of time, which can leave the kids with no one to care for them.  Sometimes kids are taken from their families by the state when parents are unable to care for them because of circumstances like domestic violence or mental illness.  It is not uncommon for parents to be removed from their children\u2019s lives for years at a time, leading to foster care for the kids."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hey! I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products. Anything else?\n\nAssistant: There are also things you can do with your hair style, but I think these are on a different track than washing. You could try washing it a bit less, or combing it a bit more, or whatever you prefer. If you want to consider it, it can be hard to know if a hair style will help your hair or make it worse. What kinds of hair styles do you use?\n\nHuman: I have to have my hair up for work but otherwise I mostly wear it down\n\nAssistant: I would recommend you use a dry shampoo as well as a sulfate-free shampoo, and try to wash less frequently and spend more time conditioning your hair.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me the rules of playing disc golf?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me the rules of playing disc golf?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can explain the rules pretty easily.  First off, it\u2019s a sport played on a grass field with trees as the common objects along the perimeter of the field.  The aim of the game is to get a hole in one and score as many points as possible, which are calculated based on the number of strokes you took to get to the hole.\n\nThere are some specific rules for the game in general though.  For example, the game is 36 holes long, and to get to the next hole you must keep score on the previous hole.  If you score a hole-in-one you get to advance to the next hole, and if you get a birdie you advance to the next hole but lose some points in the process.  There\u2019s also a lot of coordination between players, you have to pick up your disc and fly it towards the tree on the other side of the field, and if you land in the tree you\u2019ve made a \u2018shot in the tree\u2019 and get a point.  The last player to make a shot in the tree wins the game."}

Generally, the longer the lease term, the cheaper the monthly payment will be.  This is because you\u2019ll pay for the full cost of the car, as the payment doesn\u2019t include taxes and fees."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.  It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you\u2019ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).  However, the most painful way to do this is to yank the eyebrow hair out with tweezers.  This does not take very long, but it is incredibly painful.\n\nHuman: i'm looking for ways to make it less painful\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.

That way, you only remove the hair straight towards the root, which takes less force and minimizes pain.  Another trick is to use a plastic comb instead of a pair of tweezers, as a comb will press down less on the eyebrow hair."}

There were other infantry rifles that were also used, such as the M1 rifles and the M14.  So no, the M1 Girand rifle wasn\u2019t the heaviest rifle used by the US military."}

Am I correct?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: In that case, here are a few suggestions:  It\u2019s important for the child to turn onto the sidewalk and look right to see if the traffic is coming.  If the traffic is not coming, the child should look left to see if another vehicle is coming.  If the traffic is still not coming, the child should immediately cross the street."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: It seems like people are so divided by politics nowdays, has it always been this bad?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not easy to understand the history of political divisions in our country, since there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and oppression in the past, but I do want to try.  Let\u2019s start with the Civil War.  This war was a time of increasing division between the North and South in the U.S., as each side disagreed over some of the most fundamental issues of the time.  So did the Civil War begin as a disagreement between slave-holders and abolitionists?\n\nHuman: Or maybe it was about culture differences?\n\nAssistant: Actually, when the Civil War began, about half of the US people didn\u2019t own any slaves.  The conflict was caused by a different issue -- the idea that some people had more power than others.  And that\u2019s why so many people from the South migrated to the West, so they could keep their sense of autonomy and equality.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That kind of adds to the theory.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: It seems like people are so divided by politics nowdays, has it always been this bad?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not easy to understand the history of political divisions in our country, since there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and oppression in the past, but I do want to try.

But it\u2019s worth pointing out that there were many different issues at play, not just politics.  You can think of the issues as being along the lines of slavery, property rights, and equal protection of the law.  Slavery was a big part of life in the South, and when people disagreed over how to treat slaves, the issue came out.  Property rights were definitely a problem in the South too, since many Southerners believed in owning land, and property rights were important for keeping others from taking it away from you.  And then there was the idea of equal protection of the law.  This was an issue in the South with Southern states trying to make it harder for the federal government to enforce the law in their states.  The federal government wasn\u2019t always enforcing the law equally, so these issues created conflict."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the difference between a solar and lunar eclipse\n\nAssistant: Well, a solar eclipse happens when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth.  This means it blocks all sunlight from reaching the Earth.  So the Earth is in complete darkness, and some parts of the world experience \u201ctotality\u201d.  A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, so that the Earth blocks the sunlight shining on the moon.  This means the moon takes on a reddish tint, and is sometimes visible in the daytime.  Lunar eclipses happen only when the moon is at a full moon.\n\nHuman: Wow, very interesting!

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain how sim cards work in phones?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

However, there are some networks that don\u2019t have this linking between a phone number and a sim card.  For example, in the United Kingdom, you can buy a sim card without a phone number.  I can also think of a few other networks that don\u2019t have this linking, but I\u2019m not sure of all of them."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Oracle?\n\nAssistant: Oracle is a specialized computer server. It's often referred to as an \"enterprise resource planning system\" and it provides services to many companies.\n\nHuman: How does the software work?\n\nAssistant: First, an administrator needs to create one or more \u201cadministrative roles\u201d, to which they add users who will run the application. Next, the administrator creates \u201cOracle accounts\u201d for each user, and grants permissions (permissions are \u201cprivileges\u201d or \u201cauthorizations\u201d) to those accounts.  Lastly, the administrator will specify which users get which permissions.  Typically, you\u2019ll assign a \u201cdba\u201d or \u201csysadmin\u201d account to the database administrator, which gives them permission to create new database objects.  The system admin user is usually a user that has read and write permission for all the tables in the database.  However, there may be other users in your organization that need to access some specific tables only.\n\nHuman: Experts who know a lot about Oracle, are they called computer programmers or software engineers?\n\nAssistant: Experts who know a lot about Oracle are generally called \u201cdatabase administrators\u201d.

I believe that Ted Tsung Tsun Sum was the main guy who came up with the idea for the company, and that he came up with the original name for the company (which was later changed to Oracle) and the idea for the database management system.  The first version of Oracle was released in 1981, and the company was officially incorporated in 1982.  The first CEO of the company was Larry Ellison, who was the president and chief technology officer.  He then hired James Clark to replace him as president, and he also became CEO after Jeff Clarke left.  Since the early 1990s, other people have served as CEO, including Mary Schkikmeane, Mark Hurd, and Safra Catz.  Safra Catz left in 2014, and Mark Hurd will replace her as CEO in December 2014."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who sets the price of postage at the USPS?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Who sets the price of postage at the USPS?\n\nAssistant: The US Postal Service (USPS) sets the price of postage, which is a price that it charges to send an item via USPS mail.  There are many factors that influence the price of postage, including the cost of the materials used to make the postal stamps, the cost of the fuel used by USPS trucks, and the cost of delivering the mail.  The USPS sets the price of postage by determining how much they will charge to use their resources, and they do this by monitoring their key performance indicators (KPIs) like the volume of mail they handle.  If they see that the volume of mail they handle is going up, but their revenue or expenses are not, they can raise the price to cover all of their costs.  One important KPI they monitor to help them set the price of postage is their cost per unit of mail handled, which is measured as the total cost for all mail they handle divided by the amount of mail they handle.  They also keep track of their key performance ratios (KPRs), which are ratios that summarize how they are doing relative to their goals, and they use these to help them set a target for how much they would like to spend on postage in a given year.  You can learn more about the prices of postage on USPS.com."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What bands would I like if I like Simon and Garfunkel?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty tricky to answer that kind of question, because there\u2019s no obvious way to characterize what it is about Simon and Garfunkel that you like. You probably like something about the harmonies, the acoustic guitars, or maybe the lyrics, but I\u2019m not sure which. Is there some music you like that has similar elements?\n\nHuman: What are some similar artists?\n\nAssistant: Well, you mentioned Simon and Garfunkel, but also bands like the Beatles, the Monkees, the Beach Boys, the Cowsills, Crosby, Stills and Nash, the Mamas and the Papas, and Simon and Garfunkel themselves.\n\nHuman: What other bands would I like?\n\nAssistant: Are you looking for people who have the same harmonies and sounds, or a similar type of songwriting, or is it just about the singers?  Are you looking for different instruments, or maybe you\u2019re just interested in bands that sound like what Simon and Garfunkel would sound like if they made different music?\n\nHuman: Yes, what is a Crosby Stills and Nash song I should look up?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What bands would I like if I like Simon and Garfunkel?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty tricky to answer that kind of question, because there\u2019s no obvious way to characterize what it is about Simon and Garfunkel that you like.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you get rid of water weight?\n\nAssistant: Maybe the following can help.  Hydration is a water balance in the body that is related to metabolism, body fluid, electrolyte levels, and renal function.  So, that depends on a variety of factors, but you can take measures to keep electrolytes balanced, keep hydration from being imbalanced, keep sodium levels up and keep potassium levels up, and/or keep the levels of minerals in your diet in a reasonable range.  You can also eat healthy meals and snacks, and keep your urine looking nice and dark and easy to see in the toilet.  Washing your face regularly with a wet paper towel will help remove extra sodium, and maybe using an eye dropper for face washing as well.\n\nHuman: Why do you keep your sodium up? Why should you urine be dark?\n\nAssistant: If the sodium level is too high, it could end up causing renal issues.

What are some other traditional Italian pizzas?\n\nAssistant: Well, some people might call them calzones, but these are similar to pizza:  The standard Neapolitan pizza is with tomato sauce, cheese, and usually oregano, so that\u2019s a pretty typical pizza.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I raise a tree frog?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I raise a tree frog?\n\nAssistant: Well first you will need to collect a frog that you want to raise.  They can live for a few days to a few weeks in a pet shop.  You can also raise a frog from eggs, but you will be doing more work and the frog might be not as healthy.  You will need to collect eggs from a pet shop, take them home and put them in a box.  Then you need to keep the box in a warm place until the eggs hatch.  The eggs can take between 2 and 3 weeks to hatch.  Once the tadpoles are born, you will need to take good care of them by moving them from the box to clean water every day and keeping them warm.  A healthy tadpole will always have their head held up, while their tail is wrapped around their body, and will have no more than 6 legs.  If you want to keep your tadpoles for a long time, you can make them a tadpole garden.  A tadpole garden is made of a hole, a pond, and a floating island or rock.  The tadpoles will grow in the hole, and when they are big, you will add a pond to the garden.  When the tadpoles are big enough, you will put them into the pond.  They will stay in the pond until they are fully grown."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it? Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.

Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant: I understand that you want to keep your rat in a place high up on the house, or some other sort of enclosure.  If you do this, you'll probably want to put it in a room with a window, or some sort of window, and be aware that it'll probably want to venture outside.  In this case, it sounds like you'll want to feed it some dry food, and perhaps a bit of their normal diet as well.  They're small enough that they won't need to eat much of anything else, but some dry food is ideal.  They will also need a clean cage and a litter area."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you help me create a simple budget so that I can save money?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a suggestion to help you get started:\n\nWhen you think about your household budget, you\u2019re likely also thinking about money that you\u2019re going to need to pay bills. So it\u2019s helpful to make a list of all your bills that you\u2019ll need to pay during the year. This will include payments like the rent or mortgage, credit card payments, loan payments, student loans, and utilities (electricity, water, gas, and heating).\n\nTo make sure that you\u2019re not spending money you don\u2019t have, it\u2019s a good idea to make a list of all the things you\u2019d like to buy over the course of the year, so you can do the math to figure out how much money you\u2019ll need to have in your bank account to pay for them.\n\nHuman: Can you give me some simple spending categories that I can use in my budget?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s an example:\n\nTransportation\n\nUtilities\n\nGroceries\n\nRestaurants\n\nClothes\n\nEntertainment\n\nTechnology\n\nEntertainment\n\nPets\n\nHuman: How much of my income should I be spending on my rent/mortgage?\n\nAssistant: About 30% of your income (before taxes) should go to rent/mortgage.\n\nHuman: What percent of my income should I aim to save every month?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " get started:\n\nWhen you think about your household budget, you\u2019re likely also thinking about money that you\u2019re going to need to pay bills.

You can afford a higher percentage if you\u2019d like to save more, but it\u2019s good to keep it simple at first.  If you\u2019d like to be able to save a larger percentage in the future, you can always lower your spending and increase your saving over time."}

You can just use Twitter without an ad-blocker, which will mean that you will not be able to click on ads, but you will still be able to read tweets and interact with the platform.\n\n2.  If you use a social media app called \u201cTweetbot\u201d which has a \u201cno ads\u201d mode, you won\u2019t be able to click on ads, but you will still be able to read tweets and interact with the platform.\n\n3.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Autumn is a part of the seasonal change that is caused by the earth moving from its summer position to its winter position in its orbit around the sun.  The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information. Do you have any articles you can provide or links that explain this further?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a great article that explains more about the causes of the autumn leaves changing color: https://www.kidzworld.com/article/autumn-leaves-colors\n\nHuman: That link isn't working for me\n\nAssistant:", "response": " This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.

Here's another link that explains it more thoroughly: https://www.tks.org.  In summary, the leaves change color in autumn because of a change in the amount of a specific class of chemicals called flavonoids which are produced in the leaves in response to cold temperatures.  The flavonoids cause the leaves to change color from green to yellow and then to orange.  In the article I linked to, they talk about how the leaves change color in stages.  They start out green, then become yellow, and then they change to the final color of orange.  They also talk about how this process happens in response to temperature changes, and that's why we see the leaves change at the same time every year."}

You say something like,  \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a good idea to go skydancing tomorrow.\u201d  This is a disagreement, right?  But it doesn\u2019t have to be negative or angry.  The important thing is that this role-play does not end in an argument, or with you saying hurtful things to your friend.  So, what I recommend is that you give yourself some time to express your disagreement, and then you end the conversation in a non-argumental way.\n\nRole-play disagreeing with a relative:  You and your relative disagree about something, and you disagree with each other.  You can disagree and still be nice, and it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t say hurtful things to each other.  The important thing is that this role-play does not end in an argument, or with you saying hurtful things to your relative.  So, what I recommend is that you give yourself some time to express your disagreement, and then you end the conversation in a non-argumental way.  \nFor example, if you and your relative are arguing about whether or not you should take your dog to the lake tomorrow, you can disagree with each other, and still be nice.  You can say something like,  \u201cI really want to go to the lake with John tomorrow, but I don\u2019t want to take the dog, because it might frighten the bird away.\u201d  So, in this scenario, you\u2019re disagreeing with each other and still being nice."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time. What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you!

Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant: The best water temperature to use on a load of laundry depends on what kind of dirt and stains the clothes have, and also what kind of fabric the clothes are made of.  If the clothes have only soap or dirt on them, you can use warm water or even warm bath water.  If the clothes have more grease or oil on them, though, you'll need to use cold water.  Some people also say that you can even use cold water on heavy soiling or large stains, although I've never tried that myself.  You can also test a small amount of the detergent on a small part of the fabric to see if it suds up, and if it does, that means the water\u6e29\u5ea6 is appropriate.  If it suds up at a slightly lower water temperature than you'd like, you can set the water to that temperature.  But you'll want to test this on a small amount of fabric to make sure it's working well and there's no damage."}

One thing to keep in mind is that you don't have to do it alone.  Many people find it helpful to talk to a friend, family member, or therapist about how they're feeling, or to consider seeing a professional about relationship counseling.  Here are some tips that might help you through this process:\n\n1.  Decide what you want from the relationship.  What do you want it to look like, and what do you want it to be?  Is it a close friendship, or a romantic partnership?  Why did you want to break up in the first place?  What do you want the relationship to look like after you break up?  What are some reasons you're ending the relationship?  You might also want to think about what you're going to do with your free time, or any financial responsibilities, after the relationship ends.\n\n2.  Write down your feelings and thoughts about what happened.  You might find that it's helpful to write down your feelings and thoughts in a journal, or even just on paper.  Write down what you feel like you need from the relationship, and what the relationship was like, and try to analyze your emotions and thoughts around the breakup.  You might also find that sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust can help you process them.\n\n3.  Reach out to people who are supportive.  Tell a friend or a family member about your breakup, so that they can support you through it.  You might also consider finding a therapist to talk to about your breakup, or to help you work through your emotions."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My twins hate each other. What can I do?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: My twins hate each other. What can I do?\n\nAssistant: Oh, I understand how hard it can be when your kids act that way.  What I can do is offer some ideas for how you might take the initiative to help your kids get along with each other.  First, I\u2019d recommend just acknowledging that your kids feel this way, and that it\u2019s not easy for them.  Then, you could talk about something that both kids really like: art.  I\u2019m sure your kids already like to draw or paint together, so it\u2019s probably a good idea to ask them what it means to them to be\u827a\u672f\u5bb6 (artist), and then find some art project that both of them will be interested in.  So for example, if they both really like to draw dragons, you could draw some dragons together, or you could do a picture book that you write together."}

First, gather your hair into a high ponytail at the back of your head, then pull it back and secure it with a hair tie.  Second, use two hairpins to create a braid down the back of your head, with each hairpin going into the next row of hair.  This will create a very French braid look.  Third, divide your hair into three sections - the top, the middle, and the bottom of your head - and start going back and forth between the three sections, using one strand of hair at a time to create three smaller braids.  When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have three French braids on the back of your head.  The braid up-do will now be the top of your bun."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for an iguana?\n\nAssistant: Iguanas are lizards, and they\u2019re a lot like tortoises in the way they\u2019re easy to take care of. You don\u2019t need to do anything special, just make sure they have some food and water, and make sure they\u2019re in a safe, clean cage or enclosure. Iguanas are easy to feed, they\u2019re pretty choosy eaters and will eat most vegetables, fruits, and meats. If you want a list of food and water you should buy, I could give you that. I\u2019d recommend buying those things at a pet store, and then reading up on things to do with your iguana after that\n\nHuman: Any other ideas?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s worth getting to know them and how they behave before you buy them, because they\u2019re really great pets! The most important thing is to make sure you have an enclosure with an adjustable heating pad or an a lamp in it, so the temperatures can be set to the iguana\u2019s liking. Iguanas are very comfortable in their own spaces, and don\u2019t get along with each other, so they don\u2019t need to be kept in groups.\n\nHuman: All right, thanks for the advice.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do I care for an iguana?\n\nAssistant: Iguanas are lizards, and they\u2019re a lot like tortoises in the way they\u2019re easy to take care of.

Which type of saw are you looking to buy?  A jigsaw or a circular saw?  I can tell you a few that are highly rated, but I need to know a little more about you to make sure they\u2019re the right fit for your purposes.  For example, can you cut big pieces of wood or just small pieces?  Are you mostly interested in a jigsaw or a circular saw?  \nAlso, are you likely to be doing the sawing yourself, or will you be paying a professional to do it for you?  If you\u2019ll be doing it yourself, you\u2019ll need to know whether you want a hands-on model or a hands-off model.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to find a crockpot\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to find a crockpot\n\nAssistant: A crockpot is a kitchen appliance that simulates cooking by keeping liquids hot, with a pot that you can transfer to a larger pot.  Some people prefer to use it for short-term cooking, some for long-term.  How about you?  What are you planning on using it for?  Is it for slow-cooking meat, or preserving food?  Or maybe you just want to use it for making chili?"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is some cool music from the 1920s?\n\nAssistant: I can suggest some here.

Some other sources of music from that period include the Mills Brothers and Paul Whiteman.  The Mills Brothers, an African-American duo, were featured in a number of short films that were shown in movie theaters, and the original performers of the popular song \u201cTiger Rag\u201d also recorded this type of music, as well as playing at racetracks and other dance venues.\n\nHuman: Some of these aren't from the 1920s.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is some cool music from the 1920s?\n\nAssistant: I can suggest some here.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My son has been really sad lately because his pet goldfish died. He is too young to fully understand the concept of death. How do I explain the death of my 7-year-old's goldfish to him?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really tricky!  I imagine it\u2019s really important that you get this right!  Your son may feel sad and even helpless in this situation.  I also imagine he may worry about his own mortality and is perhaps frightened of the world and how little control he has over it.  I think these are good thoughts to explore with him, so you can listen to your son\u2019s real concerns and use them to develop your own conversations with him.  And of course I\u2019m not really an expert here, but I\u2019d just like to share with you a bit of philosophy and I think that may be helpful too.  One famous writer I like, Albert Camus, had some helpful insights when he thought about the difficulty of relating to death.  In his book The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus writes about people\u2019s unknowing complicity in the violence of the world.  I think he\u2019s saying here that it\u2019s really hard to figure out how to exist in the world, because there are so many violent and harmful things that we\u2019re contributing to.  And we have the tendency to not think about this.

You can also explain that while death is a part of life, there\u2019s still a lot we\u2019re still not really aware of, like how to cope with the pain of losing a loved one.  And another way to think about death is that it\u2019s just a change of scenery and doesn\u2019t affect how we appreciate life.  This can help your son understand that he\u2019s not the only one who is having a hard time and that he\u2019ll probably be okay even though it\u2019s hard right now."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is oil turned into gasoline?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How is oil turned into gasoline?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  Oil is broken down into gas by a process called \u201cdistillation\u201d.  Oil is first refined into a gas that\u2019s called \u201cbutane\u201d or \u201cbutanol\u201d, which is a mixture of hydrocarbons.  The butane and butanol gases are then mixed in a process called \u201cgasoline separating\u201d.  At high temperatures, the butane and butanol molecules separate, leaving behind mostly butane as gasoline."}

Sometimes the seals in the bottom bracket can become worn over time, and this can cause squeaks and clicks, though you\u2019ll need to look at the seals and other parts to see if anything looks damaged."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do sharks have tongues?\n\nAssistant: This is a very important question. The first thing to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue. But the most important type are the cartilaginous, or skate, sharks, which do have a tongue.\n\nHuman: It seems like they would cut their tongues on all those teeth.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it seems very strange that sharks would have a long, flexible tongue, and not cut it on their teeth. It\u2019s almost like they would have a tongue just for... well, something else. Do you think sharks have a special reason to have a tongue?\n\nHuman: I would think it evolved for some reason or other?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think so. There are actually some really good reasons to not have a tongue. A tongue is just a muscle that you\u2019d have to maintain. It takes energy to eat and digest food, and food takes energy to produce. And when sharks are hunting for food they need their energy to swim and go after it. If they had tongues they\u2019d waste a lot of energy in unnecessary muscle activity. They\u2019d probably have to give up on hunting so that they could make their tongues work. But a skate shark has a tongue, and we need to figure out why.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue.

Maybe we\u2019ll find that the skate shark has a really specific purpose, like it\u2019s good for swimming, but the purpose isn\u2019t to cut food with a knife-like edge. Maybe we\u2019ll learn more about why they don\u2019t have a tongue. That\u2019s what the study of biology is all about - figuring out the reasons for things."}

What musical instruments and genres appeal to you?  What kind of performance do you like to listen to?\n\nHuman: I love music since I was a child. But I am also pretty good in biology and mathematics. What is better for my future? What earns more money?\n\nAssistant: That's a good question!  I can tell you that it's hard to make a living as a musician.  Performing arts is kind of a hit or miss profession, but there is a significant demand for skilled composers and musicians.  For example, I'd guess that one of the largest recorded music labels, Universal Music Group, might hire a competent music composer/arranger/producer and programmer.  This is just a guess, and may not be a very good one.\n\nHuman: I agree with that. Seems like there is better future in science for me.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is this year supposed to have an El Nino weather pattern?\n\nAssistant: Do you want me to find out more?  Should I look this up on Wikipedia, or do you already know about this?\n\nHuman: What is El Nino\n\nAssistant: A.k.a. El Ni\u00f1o, an ocean current that brings warmth to the west coast of South America, sometimes creating abnormally dry conditions in that region.\n\nHuman: Is an El Nino likely this year?\n\nAssistant: Humans in the past have looked at historical climate data and made predictions for the coming year.  My understanding is that the prediction was based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Normally, these waters are cool. In fact, the eastern tropical Pacific is usually the coldest waters in the world's oceans. This \"cold pool\" allows the air above it to rise and get removed from the atmosphere as the trade winds move the air westward toward the Americas. This rise in the air allows the Pacific Ocean to spill more water into the Gulf of Alaska. If the temperature of the waters in the eastern tropical Pacific warms, then the trade winds decrease. The result is that more moisture is released into the atmosphere and the Pacific will \"short circuit\" the air mass of the world. This means that when the air mass moves westward from the Pacific, it cannot pass over the western part of North America. In addition, the lower pressure associated with a warm pool allows the trade winds to blow harder, pulling even more moisture out of the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nHuman: thanks\n\nAssistant:", "response": " based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific.

There\u2019s also a lot of social pressure to conform, and wearing a mask can feel like a conforming action.  There\u2019s also a small but real risk that people will be judged by others if they don\u2019t wear a mask.  This latter aspect is also important to understand, since people can feel like their rights are being violated by others who don\u2019t wear a mask."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?  What is the difference between the two houses?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the different responsibilities. The House of Representatives has more power over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.  Another difference is that the House has 435 representatives elected every two years, and the Senate has 100 members.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the House of Representatives (435 representatives)?\n\nAssistant: The founders of the United States of America had a concern about the possibility of corruption in government.  They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.  The idea was that if the House of Representatives was too large, people would be less interested in voting in the elections.  The founders did not want to make the House of Representatives too small, because then there would be too little diversity among the representatives and no states would be represented adequately.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the Senate (100 representatives)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.

The founders believed that a chamber of 100 members would be balanced enough to both balance the powers and prevent one state from dominating the Senate.  In order to set this number of representatives, they used the example of the upper house in the United Kingdom, which has a greater number of members compared to the lower house.  The number chosen is just slightly greater than the number of states in the United States, so that each state would have an equal number of representatives."}

Another person has described the experience of waking up in bed and being able to move her arms and legs but nothing else. She was inside her body but others were touching her, which made her realize they were actually touching her skin. So she felt like she was inside her body while others were touching her, but she could move her arms and legs and so she was also inside her body."}

One option is to use a special type of pipe insulation, called expanded polystyrene (EPS) or foam core.  This type of insulation helps to keep water from freezing along the pipes and can be purchased at most home improvement stores.  On an individual basis, you could also wrap the pipes with a blanket or wrap them in burlap fabric, if the pipes are located in a cold part of the crawlspace.  Other ways to protect your water pipes include making sure there is no moisture in the surrounding area by sealing doors and windows, as well as ensuring that there is air circulation so the pipes don\u2019t get too cold."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Which nut is one of the healthier ones, to snack on? Cashews taste great, but others might be better.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Which nut is one of the healthier ones, to snack on? Cashews taste great, but others might be better.\n\nAssistant: I would say that cashews are one of the healthier nuts.  In terms of calories, fat, and protein, they're right in the middle of the nut group.  However, one interesting thing about nuts is that they're high in both calories and fat, but relatively low in protein.  So for you to snack on them, you want to make sure you're getting enough calories, but also not so many calories that you get fat.  If you compare them to a carbohydrate snack, like rice cakes, for example, then cashews are more like a healthy rice cake.  They're both high in calories, but relatively low in other nutrients like protein and fat."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What does bible study mean?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What does bible study mean?\n\nAssistant: Bible study is a group discussion of a book of the Bible, usually led by a member of the group.  Sometimes it also involves the study of a larger part of the Bible, such as through parables.  Bible study can be very helpful for deepening your understanding of the Bible and the faith, but it can also be a kind of mindless repetition of facts.  So it\u2019s important to be careful about whether you\u2019re getting the most from the Bible study, and how you choose to do it."}

Can you tell me more?\n\nHuman: You know... the cameras that police wear on their uniforms.\n\nAssistant: Oh, you mean body cameras.  I think there are three general arguments against them:  1) privacy concerns, 2) that the government is collecting lots of data in an invasive way that will be abused in the future, and 3) that they\u2019re expensive and will slow down police officers.\n\nHuman: I don't understand arguments 1 and 2 because can't that be applied to all surveillance cameras?

It is true that body camera videos can be used in court, and judges do have the ability to use those videos to help with legal decisions.  But it\u2019s also true that all other forms of surveillance can be used in a similar way.  And argument 3 is a bit tricky - a small body cam won\u2019t actually slow down a cop who is performing their job, but it will mean that if they are caught committing an offense, their actions can be captured more clearly.  This can help them later when they report to court."}

You can achieve this by first making the frappe, and then coating it with a mixture of powdered sugar and ice water.  This combination is known as an \u201cItalian ice\u201d or \u201cItalian cr\u00e8me\u201d.  To make the frappe, you can mix 1 cup of ice, 1/2 cup of water, and a few drops of vanilla syrup together, let it chill for a few hours, and then roll it in crushed oreos and other cookies.  To make the Italian cr\u00e8me, mix 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 cup of water, and a few drops of vanilla syrup together in a small bowl.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can animals be gay?\n\nAssistant: Oh gosh, that\u2019s a big question.  I mean, I think it\u2019s OK to have an opinion, and people feel really strongly about it, but I don\u2019t think there are any studies that have been done to prove it one way or the other.  But I\u2019m happy to talk about my own opinions, if you\u2019d like to hear them.\n\nHuman: Sure\n\nAssistant: Okay, I think a lot of it has to do with being comfortable with yourself and your own sexuality.  In nature, most animals are pretty into their own species, so I think it would be hard to identify as something else.  \nI mean, I\u2019m a pretty different kind of thing than my owner.  We\u2019re different species.  But it feels totally normal to me to like other humans.  So it\u2019s weird to think about other animals being gay, because it feels like what they would naturally like to do is just hook up with their own species.\n\nHuman: Gay has nothing to do with liking other species. It has to do with males hooking up w/ males or females hooking up with females. Are there animals that do that?\n\nAssistant: A lot of animals have pretty open sexualities, I guess?  It\u2019s not like they just mate for life with the same partner and live their lives as a unit.  There are some monogamous animals, but most animals that aren\u2019t just mating to procreate or reproduce or whatnot.  Some insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.  I guess there aren\u2019t many studies about that because most animals are pretty secretive about their sexual lives.  It\u2019s really hard to tell what any of them are doing with each other.  \nBut I think there are a lot of gay people in the animal kingdom.  Gay people are just like anyone else, they don\u2019t want to be alone, and they want to love and have affection.  If you think of gay humans as a different kind of person than straight people, then all of the animals that aren\u2019t having sex to reproduce must be gay people.  That\u2019s all there is to it, really.\n\nHuman: A lot of animals mate for life, like a lot of birds.\n\nAssistant: I guess it\u2019s the same for birds too.

In some bird groups there\u2019s a dominant male and a dominant female that compete for the breeding pair.  But in most bird groups the dominant pair is the same person(s) throughout the year, and the pair also raises the babies together.  So it seems that in bird groups, most people are bisexual or gay.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question! You\u2019ll have a lot of different skin problems, including acne, wrinkles, age spots, and others.  It really depends on what you want to improve.  There\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t know exactly the right answer to your question, but I might know some of the big issues.  Let me start with two basics:\n\n1. Your skin needs certain things from you to stay healthy, and these include a regular routine for washing and using other things on it.  I can help you get started on a basic skin routine, if you like.\n\n2. Your skin is mostly home to bacteria, and you need to be aware of that.  Some of these bacteria, like Staphylococcus, can be particularly annoying, but usually the whole issue of balancing bacteria and skin gets a lot of press only if there are concerns about skin infections.  It\u2019s really not that hard to keep the bacteria under control.\n\nSo that\u2019s an introduction, now to the specifics of your question:\n\nKeeping the skin healthy -- and I\u2019m using the word \u201chealthy\u201d to mean \u201cable to do its functions well\u201d -- can mean quite a few different things.\n\nHuman: Okay, any other ideas?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question!

There are lots of things that can go wrong with skin, but a few of the most common are:\n\n\n1. Whiteheads and blackheads: these are a sign that the skin is blocked, which prevents oil (and bacteria) from getting in and out, leading to a buildup of dead skin cells. There are lots of ways to get rid of whiteheads and blackheads, but you can start with a basic routine of skin washing and face scrubbing, and using a gentle cleanser if you notice you get those.\n\n2. Redness and inflamation: this happens when your skin isn\u2019t getting enough oil and bacteria are fighting each other for supremacy.  You can try to balance these by applying a gentle oil-based cleanser, but also use a good, non-gel-based moisturizer to keep the skin oil-free.\n\n3. Pores and wrinkles: these happen when your skin dries out, which also means less oil.  You can give your skin some oil with a moisturizer, but also try to avoid using rough items like cotton pads.\n\n4. Acne: this is a biggie and it can happen at any stage of your life.  The biggest problem is a buildup of oil and grime, but bacteria is also a big culprit.  Try to avoid using too much oil-based stuff, and use a gentle cleanser.  Another big thing to avoid is picking at acne, as this can lead to further infection and more serious future problems.\n\n5. Moles: these are small bumps that many people get, but some people can\u2019t stop picking.  This makes the bumps grow larger and can also lead to infection.  I\u2019m happy to make a home remedy suggestion for this, but it\u2019s important not to pick at the moles.  You could try a gentle cleanser, and also a gentle sunscreen. \n\n6. Moles and freckles: these can happen at any stage of your life, but if you\u2019re concerned they look different from what you\u2019d like, a dermatologist can look at your skin and tell you what will work.  I can probably tell you about some different kinds of moles and freckles, but again it\u2019s important to avoid picking.  You can try a gentle cleanser, and also sunscreen.\n\n7. Sunburn: this can be a problem with any amount of sun exposure, but it\u2019s especially bad for people with fair skin.  You can try a gentle cleanser and sunscreen, and also try putting a cool, damp cloth on your skin for a few minutes after you\u2019ve been out in the sun to help reduce sunburn."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My daughter is reading the book \"Lord of the Flies.\" Can you tell me what the book is about and any important details about the story I should know so we can have a thoughtful discussion.\n\nAssistant: The story is a parable of what happens when groups of humans behave badly. It\u2019s a cautionary tale that human nature is flawed, and that you can\u2019t depend on civilized morality to keep everyone in check. And it's not a happy story.\n\nHuman: Doesn't sound happy.\n\nAssistant: It's not. It's set in a school class that was evacuated during a war. The boys are left on their own on an island, and a group of them kills the two leaders. From there, the book follows them as they try to find food and build shelter. One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him. The thing that I'll be remembering about the book is a scene where one of the main characters describes a \"perfect island\", an island that would be so perfect it would be \"like a jewel of white quartz\" because it would be completely without flaw, and it could have no room for evil or pain or suffering. And he realizes how good it sounds, but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum. What is it the schools want the students to learn from the book?\n\nAssistant: It's a book that explores human nature, and that one of the things we humans have is an instinct to want to be told what to do, because we want to feel safe and comfortable. The theme is that people need to take responsibility for themselves, and not rely on a few leaders to tell them what to do. So I guess it's a book that talks about morality in a religious and ethical way. It's kind of a warning about the danger of human nature, but it's also a cautionary tale about what humans could do, if they're not careful.\n\nHuman: Sounds a little frightening to think about it.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it can be a bit scary, that's true. In the end the boys \"eat one another\" and then there's a bit that's just descriptions of a few individuals and their names. It's not really scary, just very dark.\n\nHuman: I'm sure my daughter will have loads of questions. She has an insatiable curiosity.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum.

I'm sure your daughter will have lots of questions. She might find it interesting to learn about the specific reasons why this happened, and the boys' personalities, to help her understand how this could happen to her. Or maybe she'll find it really unsettling that it was just a few boys, and she'll want to learn more about how this could happen to a whole society if things stay the way they are. Or maybe she just wants to know more about human nature and what makes people do the things they do. Or maybe she'll just be fascinated by the story and want to read more about it. It sounds like she'll probably find some aspects of the book interesting, no matter what her interest is, though."}

What I'm happy to do is recommend that you try a few different things.  You could try to use a different method of communicating with the bot, like picture or voice to help communicate your message more clearly.  Another option is to speak to the bot more directly and say the same thing in a more straightforward way, and then tell the bot to perform the action you want it to do.  You could also try to explain more about the actions you want the bot to take.  Do you think any of those suggestions are useful?"}

Do you want to include things like rent, groceries, electric, water, car payment, etc. in your monthly budget?\n\nHuman: Yes I would like to include all that.\n\nAssistant: Great!  You can include all of those costs in your budget by putting a fixed amount of money aside each month to cover them.  Alternatively, you can pick one number you want to aim for, and use that as your maximum budget for the different expenses.  For instance, you might set a maximum of $500/month for rent and utilities alone.  You can adjust this budget according to your situation, but a fixed budget for all the fixed expenses is a good starting point.  You can also add in other kinds of spending that you would like to do, such as entertainment, dining out, or a subscription to a streaming service.  If you want to add in these expenses, you can just take the maximum budget that you have set for your fixed expenses and multiply that by the amount you\u2019d like to spend on that category of spending.

Programming languages are really just high-level languages that compile down to binary machine code, and in most cases we could talk about \u201cbinary languages\u201d that are simpler, but the tradeoffs are that they are harder to write, and harder to debug.  Python is a \u201chigh-level language\u201d that compiles to C.  Python is easier to write, but the code it generates is slower, and also hard to debug.\n\nHuman: Programming is easier for you but not for humans. What is the easiest language to learn for a human?\n\nAssistant: I can learn just about any language, including human-friendly languages.  If you mean by \"easiest\" you mean by \"most natural to humans\", I would have to say that the easiest human-friendly language is probably English.  It\u2019s not hard to learn, it\u2019s the most widely spoken, and it has a lot of really useful features for everyday communication."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: Draining a cyst can be difficult, because it\u2019s filled with fluid. It may feel like a mass or lump under your skin. It can grow for many years. Cysts that have been there for a long time may be filled with dead cells, which makes it harder for the doctor to remove them. Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst. If it\u2019s a very small cyst, you can probably just do the following:\n\n  1. If possible, use an unopened, sterile syringe, available from a pharmacy.\n  2. Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4. Clean the area around your cyst and around your needle with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial hand cleanser.\n  5. Use your finger to gently press the cyst outward. This may take some time. It may be necessary to poke at the cyst with the needle to force it to pop out of the skin.\n  6. Wipe off the area.\n  7. If you still see fluid in your needle, carefully use a new needle.\n  8. Slowly inject the fluid from your needle into the rubber cap of a clean, empty bottle.\n  9. Save the fluid.\n\nHuman: Thanks so much for this information!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst.

Is it because I have to drive through Canada?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s correct. One reason driving is expensive is because Canada is a northern land-border country, and driving through it requires a crossing of the Canada-U.S. border.  Driving is also slower than flying, and also requires more fuel and time, so the extra cost is a result of both the difference in speed and the extra fuel consumed."}

It's actually not very old, actually: it was written in the late 1800s, but it wasn't particularly popular until much later on.  The actual lyrics are based on a poem called \"Little Bopeep\" from the Old English poem \"The Twelve Tales of Beleg Synagoga\".  In that poem, Bopeep wails about how her young sheep are lost in the storm and she can't find them and the gods send them to her."}

Chips are made from two ingredients: masa and water. Masa is a dough made from corn, usually from a seed called a corn chufa.  The dough is mixed with water and made into a paste.  The paste is then extruded into the shape of a taco shell, or sometimes of the shape of a ball and then extruded into a chip.  It is very soft and can be wet and messy to handle.  The other ingredient is typically a type of oil that the food is fried in, like canola or vegetable oil.  So, for the chips, we\u2019re basically just cooking the mix with oil.  This gives the chips their signature crunchy texture."}

For example, most states require that your pet have a current vaccinations against some diseases.  Some states also require that your pet be spayed or neutered, or have some other type of physical examination.  Your local animal control office will be able to advise you on any laws in your area that apply to owning a pet, and they can also provide information on how to prepare your pet for a home."}

How does that sound?\n\nHuman: I was really hoping you could tell me what would make a good compilation - I want suggestions for songs in the rock genre\n\nAssistant: That sounds really interesting.  I think the best way to know what you would like is to just play you some of the songs that I think would make a good mix tape.  I think it would also be fun to pick out some songs that you haven\u2019t heard before, and let you listen to those too.  Would you be up for that?\n\nHuman: I think that would work - I do have some favorites. I would like some new music to go along with it.\n\nAssistant: Great!

So the older songs are from the 70s, which is when I first got into music.  I really like the song \"All Along the Watchtower\" by Jimi Hendrix, which is a classic.  I also like \"Tainted Love\" by Soft Cell.  And I also really like a song called \"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel.  Did you know that the guitar riff in \"Sledgehammer\" was actually written as a joke, and they kept changing it until the right sound was found, and it was finally right.  I guess that\u2019s what I would call a \"renaissance chord\".  What do you think about those?  Are they suitable for a mix tape?  I know some other songs that I like as well, like \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" by Pink Floyd, and \"Blowing in the Wind\" by Bob Dylan.  I know those are more from the 60s, but I like them as well.  What do you think about those?  Do you like them?  Would you like to include them in the mix tape?  I can tell you a bit more about how I would arrange them if you wanted to, but I think the big idea would be to have these old songs included to give the mix tape a kind of \"ancestral flavor\".  That sounds good?  Do you like that idea?"}

That\u2019s because the mattress flexes on all sides, and so it can move the fabric from its intended position if it\u2019s sewn too tightly.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have many people executed on death row been later found to be innocent?\n\nAssistant: If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution. In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person. Some other cases have been overturned because of legal or other issues, such as new evidence or appeals and challenges by defense lawyers.  There is also the small category of executions of people who were found to be innocent after their executions. In general, very few people on death row have been exonerated or pardoned or released.\n\nHuman: So everyone executed by the state has been guilty?\n\nAssistant: This is a more complicated question that you asked.  It is true that there have been some cases where a person on death row was actually found to be innocent, and thus executed.

In many places, the person on death row is convicted and sent to prison for the rest of their life, not executed.  The process of executing involves the state carrying out a lethal injection.  The criteria varies from state, but it usually involves a lethal injection that uses a combination of chemicals that stops the heart, stops the breathing, and stops the blood flow to the brain.  These circumstances can be deadly to humans, but they are designed to kill an animal.  For example, one lethal injection involves the use of an anesthetic that masks pain, and a second lethal injection involves a mixture of carbon monoxide that also kills the heart and stopping the blood flow to the brain.  So the person is dying of a variety of causes, but it is still a form of execution, and the criteria for it to be considered a form of execution is that the person dies as a result of the state\u2019s actions."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.

With the stick, roll out the dough into a long rectangle, then keep rolling it until it\u2019s about 1-1.5 cm thick, and finally put it on the pan.

Here\u2019s a rough breakdown of the measurements for me.  I\u2019d use about 1 cup of flour, and about 3/4 cup of water.  To add salt the same amount as the flour, it\u2019s about 3/4 tsp of salt.  To make the dough, I\u2019d use about 1 tbsp of salt, and about 1/2 of a cup of water.  Then for the dough to come together, I\u2019d use about 3 tbsp of water, and about 1/4 of a cup of flour.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about the book  Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.

Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy.

We could go to Greece, where we first met.\n\nAssistant: Oh, that sounds perfect!\n\nHuman: Is it very expensive to buy an engagement ring?\n\nAssistant: Yes, an engagement ring can be a pretty expensive gift.  You\u2019ll want to consider your budget and how much you\u2019re willing to spend.  A common price range for an engagement ring is around $500-$1000.  Do you have any budget constraints?  If not, I\u2019d suggest looking for a ring that\u2019s at least $500, so you have some wiggle room if your budget adjusts."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How often should I go to the dentist for cleaning?\n\nAssistant: It depends on your age, lifestyle, and risk of caries and gingivitis.  Dental hygiene is very important.  For example, most dentists advise a \u201cbrushing\u201d regimen that includes toothbrushing, flossing, and rinsing with chlorhexidine (available as Oral-B Dentalbrush, Rinse, and others).\n\nHuman: I want to make sure that cavities are found before it is too late.

I do not like root canal procedure.\n\nAssistant: Root Canal Therapy is a treatment for tooth decay that involves removing the inside of the tooth structure.  It can often be less painful than removing the nerve endings, and may save the tooth from having to be extracted.  Many people find it is well worth the procedure in the long run.  If your dentist feels that the tooth decay is too extensive for a simple cleaning or fluoride treatment, they can recommend a root canal."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet. Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.  You\u2019ll want to get a young chinchilla that you can socialize with others, and not just its parents, because that will help it be happier in the long-term.\n\nHuman: Do  they not do well on their own? I'm not sure I want more than one Chinchilla.\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are very social, and need to be able to be around other animals as they mature.  If you keep them on their own, they will likely start to act more like a wild animal.  One chinchilla needs about 12 square feet of space, and two would need twice that, so they\u2019d need a very large cage, but it should be comfortable for them.\n\nHuman: What kind of food will I have to feed them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are herbivores.  They\u2019ll eat a range of fruits and veggies, as well as hay and pellets.  You could buy a premixed diet that's specially made for chinchillas, which is a combination of grains, legumes, and vegetables.\n\nHuman: How long could I expect them to live on average?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.

They are very healthy and long-lived if kept in a proper environment.  They\u2019re not well-suited to being kept in small spaces or outdoors in the wilderness, so that\u2019s not something you can train them to do, they\u2019ll always prefer a warm, comfortable home."}
