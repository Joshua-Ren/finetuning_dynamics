What sort of vitamins are you looking to get?  Vitamin A, C, E, D, and B vitamins are especially important.  What foods do you eat?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd like to make sure that I'm getting enough of the essential vitamins from the food that I buy. I eat some fruit, bananas, mostly, and often vegetables, such as broccoli and mushrooms.

You can also eat lots of colored vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Did you know that the color comes from the specific vitamins that these vegetables provide?  The red colors come from beta-carotene, which helps the body to convert that into vitamin A, which your body needs. \nThis is just one example of the importance of eating the whole vegetable, including all of its colors.  In general, it\u2019s important to get lots of different kinds of colorful vegetables in your diet.  And you can also add beans and nuts to your diet.\n\nHuman: Great.

Are there particular vitamins in foods that help the skin and hair?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are two particular vitamins that are related to the health of the skin and hair.  Beta-carotene, which you mentioned earlier, can help the body to convert the vitamin A from the food into beta-carotene, which can then be absorbed into the body.  And this vitamin A can help you to maintain good skin and hair.  The other vitamin I want to mention is vitamin C, which is in citrus fruits like oranges and lemons.  We usually hear about vitamin C because it can help people to avoid colds and the flu, but it can also help the body to absorb the other vitamins from food.

There are also vitamins and minerals that can help the body to produce a protein called keratin, which can also help protect and support the skin, hair, and nails.  There are also vitamins and minerals that can help the body to produce collagen, which can also help protect and support the skin, hair, and nails.

France's best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I find out who the most popular music artists of 2021 are?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I find out who the most popular music artists of 2021 are?\n\nAssistant: There are lots of different data sources you could use to find this information. The most obvious one is Wikipedia, but it doesn\u2019t have up-to-date data. You could try using some of the various music streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube Music. These apps have APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that can pull out data from music platforms, including charts and statistics, but it\u2019s difficult to find a complete table of data that shows what\u2019s been popular. One way to do that is by querying their APIs and scraping data with various Python and Ruby libraries, but that\u2019s much more complicated. Another way is to look at social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Some people have created apps for these platforms that could give you access to that kind of data. But it\u2019s hard to find people\u2019s data, because Facebook and Twitter require a lot of permission to get. It\u2019s much easier to scrape music data from streaming services directly. Or even on a website you wouldn\u2019t expect."}

Can you tell me more about St. Patrick?\n\nAssistant: I can tell you a lot more! St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, which is a small island off the coast of Europe. St. Patrick was born in Ireland and spent most of his life in Britain. He was originally a Christian priest in Britain, and converted many Pagans and Roman pagans to Christianity by preaching his teachings. He is also known for driving snakes out of Ireland.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: So every now and then I wake up with a sore shoulder that makes the day very long. is there any exercises I can do to help relieve pain?\n\nAssistant: My understanding is that the best thing for you right now would be to get some massage therapy, with a licensed professional, where they use touch to relax the tight areas and increase blood flow, and then help your body to heal.\n\nHuman: Yes that would be great, but not an option at the moment due to time and funds limitations.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to learn more about the board game Monopoly.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m very glad you mentioned Monopoly. I know a lot about the game. It\u2019s actually about the history of capitalism.\n\nHuman: Who were the designers of the board game?\n\nAssistant: The designers were an American family. They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.  She worked on playing the game, and wrote down her observations in a little notebook. Charles used the information from her notebook to make adjustments to the game.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who is considered the best golf player of all time and why?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question because there are many dimensions to consider when evaluating a golf player. For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does \u201cbest\u201d refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others.\n\nHuman: Okay, interesting. I know he was really good for a few years but then went into a slump. Did you take that into account?\n\nAssistant: This is true, but the human ability to distinguish \u201cdown periods\u201d from \u201cslumps\u201d is surprisingly accurate. While our perceptions of when an athlete is performing well may not be perfectly accurate, in general our perception of the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d can be fairly good, as compared to other historical sports. For example, in the NBA, players like Lebron James and Michael Jordan are both recognized as the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d, despite Lebron\u2019s time in Miami (and his continued success in Cleveland) being viewed as a \u201cslump\u201d. If anything, we tend to undervalue Lebron because his best teams weren\u2019t all from Cleveland.\n\nHuman: Okay, I guess that makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " ranking in a list?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: You can buy property through a real estate agent or a realtor. There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash. In the U.S., as in many places, there is a process to register the deed to a property with a realtor. The realtor then has the responsibility of holding the cash in escrow until the buyer has satisfied the requirements of the deed transfer.\n\nHuman: I see. That makes sense. I assume the realtor of course would get something from helping both parties. How much do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price. In some states they are not allowed to charge any fee. The realtor can also be paid with a commission, and in that case the realtor may get a commission of 5% to 10% of the selling price.  There are also taxes, transaction fees, and closing costs.\n\nHuman: Does the buyer pay for those costs, or the seller?\n\nAssistant: Both parties pay for some of those.

The realtor will be able to explain in more detail.\n\nHuman: Thank you again. If say either the buyer or the seller wants to cancel the transaction, will there still be fees involved?\n\nAssistant: The seller may get some back if the sale doesn\u2019t close, but the buyer will have to pay a fee to the realtor in the form of a transaction fee if the sale falls through.\n\nHuman: I really appreciate your help.

In science they use the scientific method, which is usually based on research, so scientists generally try to understand something by asking questions and testing their assumptions.

It was created in 1933 and ended in 1943. The WPA was an umbrella term for a variety of programs managed by the Federal government. The WPA created jobs for thousands of citizens. The projects became famous for being highly publicized and well-known. This made it very easy for the American people to feel good about the government\u2019s response to helping the needy. It also helped to make the president, Herbert Hoover, very popular with the American people. The WPA was a very important period in the history of the United States, and continues to be remembered and admired as a period in which the American public was able to feel a sense of hope and help to those who needed it most."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What can you tell me about the philosophy of John Locke\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What can you tell me about the philosophy of John Locke\n\nAssistant: I can answer this question, by describing his philosophical perspective.  Locke believed that human nature is inherent in our free-will decision making, and that this is the driving force behind all our actions.  According to him, the nature we were born with is what allows us to act freely and responsibly.  So for example, a baby can make choices about how to react to its environment when it is being breastfed, or when it is being fed and/or held by its mother.  In this sense, we can say that this baby has free will, and will act as it sees fit.  This free-will is at the root of our actions."}

Some people also like to plant beets, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for beginners.  Are you planting indoors or outside?\n\nHuman: I would be planting them outside in my backyard.\n\nAssistant: Well, outside is a better option, because with most of your plants, you\u2019ll get a better yield, and the harvest will be ready sooner.

If you\u2019re planting outside, you can plant transplants, which is the fastest way to get a plant up and growing.\n\nHuman: Would they be able to survive through the winter months?\n\nAssistant: Not normally, although there are varieties that are known to survive cold temperatures.  If you\u2019re growing the vegetables outdoors you might also plant them in containers.  There are different vegetables that you can plant in pots and then they can be brought inside for the winter, so you can still get a lot of use out of them.\n\nHuman: How much space would I need to dedicate if I wanted to grow the carrots in the fall?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Are there any vegetables that I can plant in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Sure, you can plant carrots and turnips in the fall.

Have you tried some of the natural remedies, like ice packs, compression stockings, or cider vinegar?\n\nHuman: Yes. I make sure I do some sort of cardiovascular activity almost every day, like running, biking, or jumping rope. I also use compression stockings for a few hours out of each day, but I'm not sure how long I should wear them.\n\nAssistant: What kind of stockings do you use, and are you wearing them while you run, walk, or exercise?\n\nHuman: I use medical-grade compression stockings that were prescribed by my doctor. I do not use the stockings while I exercise as instructed by my doctor.\n\nAssistant: Based on the information you\u2019ve provided, it sounds like you need to be wearing the stockings while you exercise, as recommended by your doctor.  It might also help to add some stretching after exercising, since this improves circulation in the leg.  In general, doctors recommend running at least 15 minutes a day for long-term benefit.\n\nHuman: My doctors said that cycling exercises are best for circulation, as it takes the stress off the legs.\n\nAssistant: It does seem like cycling is a good exercise for you, and it does tend to put less pressure on the legs than running.   Would you be interested in creating a schedule that incorporates cycling and/or walking with your normal cardiovascular activity?  This will ensure you do enough exercise to help your circulation.\n\nHuman: Yes. I think creating a daily routine of cardiovascular activity is best for me and my circulation.\n\nAssistant: Would you like me to help you create a routine?\n\nHuman: Yes. Please help be create a routine for cardiovascular activity everyday.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " kind of stockings do you use, and are you wearing them while you run, walk, or exercise?\n\nHuman: I use medical-grade compression stockings that were prescribed by my doctor.

I can help you create a habit of exercising.  Here\u2019s a plan we can do together:\n\n-   To start, I\u2019ll help you create a five-minute warm-up routine that can be done right before you start your cycling routine.  To warm up, we can do some light stretching at the end of your cycling  (to increase blood flow) and walk 1-2 minutes on the spot where you planned to cycle (to increase your circulation)\n-   Once you\u2019re ready to cycle, we\u2019ll record the amount of time that it takes to complete  your five-minute warm-up routine, and add a 5-minute cooldown period so that you don\u2019t tire too quickly after your cycling routine.  You can use this time to stretch again.\n-   Here\u2019s the plan for the cycling routine you were going to do:\n\n-   Aim to ride 30 minutes a day\n-   In addition to the 5-minute warm-up routine, set a timer to record the time it takes you to complete\n      the cycling routine.  Start at the push up position and ride until you reach your\n      desired distance. \n-   Once you\u2019re done cycling, stretch again.  We can try to stretch in 5-minute cycles, with\n      the first cycle being the 5-minute cooldown period you set earlier.\n-   Make sure you don\u2019t overdo it.  You might feel tired after your cycling, and the\n   warming-up and cooldown cycles are there to bring you back to full energy after you"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I set food out for wild deer to eat?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I set food out for wild deer to eat?\n\nAssistant: Well, I believe there would be some predators to worry about as well. There are several predators that keep the deer in check, including coyotes, owls, owls, and birds of prey like eagles and hawks. There are, however, other predators that could pose a threat. One such predator is human hunters. While you may not want to hunt the deer themselves, it can be safer to put food out for them as a way of getting closer to them in order to alert the hunters. The deer may actually be happy to eat the food you give them, and that would encourage them to stay closer to humans, making it harder for hunters to approach them."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How are LEDs made?\n\nAssistant: We\u2019d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.  Those metals have a property called \u201cresonance\u201d, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.  A light that flashes repeatedly, as in a strobe light, causes a fluorescent material inside the tube to glow, like you see in a traffic light.\n\nHuman: Are they similar to a fluorescent bulb?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How are LEDs made?\n\nAssistant: We\u2019d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.

For example, Pluto is the farthest planet from the Sun, and its atmosphere is mostly made up of chemicals that are not found on other planets.  It also has tenuous oceans that aren\u2019t liquid, because its outer atmosphere is frozen and its inner core is molten.  Some scientists believe that if Pluto ever had an atmosphere, it would have been lost due to a collision with another object, like Neptune\u2019s moon Charon."}

What is the origin of the name \"Black Friday\"?\n\nAssistant: Historians say that stores used to mark the beginning of the holiday shopping season with a huge sale and after a few years a phrase \u201cBlack Friday\u201d was created to describe this event, with the idea that shoppers would wait in lines all day until it was their turn to buy things at discount prices."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to teach my 7 year old son how to play football. What is the best method for him to learn at that age?\n\nAssistant: Football isn\u2019t the easiest sport to learn, but it is the most useful sport for teaching a lot of fundamental skills: agility, speed, coordination, and eye-hand coordination. If you want him to be good at football and other sports in general, you will need to start teaching him when he is very young.  Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.  There is a saying, \u201cThe first step to being great at anything is to be great at the basics.\u201d\n\nHuman: ok thanks. What kind of agility drills would you suggest?\n\nAssistant: You can do all of them standing up, running, or on the ground, and you can do them with your son. You can also play little games, like tossing the ball to him, and he has to do a jump shot, or throw it back to you, but he has to jump in order to do it.\n\nHuman: ok that is a good start. do you think watching football on television will help him too?\n\nAssistant: It won\u2019t hurt.  In fact, it will help him.  As you get him started playing, start him with the basics.  Even if you don\u2019t play football yourself, you should have some kind of idea of the basics of football, so you can understand when he\u2019s doing it right and wrong.  You can also show him videos of football players like Deion Sanders, or Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nHuman: This is American football.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, my friend says I should get into U2, and I'm completely unfamiliar with the band. Can you help me put together a playlist of their best songs over the years, that will give me a representative sampling of their sound?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that.  U2 is an Irish rock band that started in the 1980s.  Over the years they\u2019ve released dozens of songs, but I\u2019m guessing your friend wants you to start with the very best of their music.  If that\u2019s right, I\u2019d suggest putting together a playlist of just their singles.  You could start with the top five most-streamed songs, and then take a look at their albums.  There might be songs on those albums that were released as singles, but didn\u2019t get as much traction.  If you want me to pick out a few more you could try out, I\u2019ll just do that manually by just looking at the song titles and lyrics, and choose a few of the best-known and most-important songs.  Here\u2019s a quick list:\n\n\u201cI Will Follow\u201d\n\u201cWith or Without You\u201d\n\u201cBeautiful Day\u201d\n\u201cDesire\u201d\n\u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d\n\u201cOne\u201d\n\u201cMysterious Ways\u201d\n\u201cStay (Faraway, So Close!)\u201d\n\u201cPride (In the Name of Love)\u201d\n\u201cElevation\u201d\n\u201cWhen Love Comes to Town\u201d\n\u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d\n\u201cCity of Blinding Lights\u201d\n\u201cVertigo\u201d\n\u201cThe Unforgettable Fire\u201d\n\u201cUntil the End of the World\u201d\n\nHave I missed anything?

How did you arrange these songs, are they chronological?\n\nAssistant: There was some overlap there, I ended up choosing to put the singles first, since it felt like those were probably the most famous, and also the easiest to find on YouTube or Spotify. You\u2019ll see that in general the first-released singles were also later albums, and so were at the front of the list.\n\nHuman: Okay. If I had to pick just one U2 album to add to this list along with the singles, what should it be?

Baking powder is a dry mixture of sodium bicarbonate (hypo) and other ingredients.  When you add it to water it starts to dissolve and react with the other ingredients to form an extrudable dough."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I cook food while camping?\n\nAssistant: The best way to cook food is over a fire.

The best way to make sure you\u2019re targeting those muscles is to get into a workout that has calf raises and lower-raises, and also squats.  You can do squats without weights, in which case you can just focus on the calves, but you would also want to do leg presses, and leg extensions to target the same muscles.

This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am attending a traditional Jewish funeral for a colleague. Can you explain to me Jewish funeral customs?\n\nAssistant: Sure. This might be a good time to explain that I am an artificial intelligence that is trained to provide information and answer questions. I can provide the relevant information based on information in the public domain and what I\u2019ve been programmed to know. Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: Absolutely.\n\nAssistant: Great! Jewish funeral customs and practices have evolved throughout the centuries. Today, people gather for a burial and an initial period of mourning before the funeral. When attending a funeral, Jewish customs require people to wear a traditional outfit, especially if they are religious. The main difference between funerals for religious and non-religious people is that religious Jews usually recite traditional Hebrew prayers during a funeral, and non-religious people usually don\u2019t.\n\nHuman: Ok. I heard the term \"shiva\". Can you explain that?\n\nAssistant: Shiva is a post-funeral ritual. It usually takes place the day after the funeral and is most commonly associated with observant Jewish culture.\n\nHuman: Who attends the Shiva?\n\nAssistant: Some of the family of the deceased may attend the shiva, including extended family.\n\nHuman: I also hear the word shomer?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re right, shomer is the Hebrew term for \u201cescort\u201d, and means the person who accompanies the body to the funeral and who watches the body during the shiva.  There is a shomer for the body at the funeral, and a shomer for the shiva.\n\nHuman: Yes. I heard some families have a shomer sit with the deceased in the funeral home prior to the burial.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " funeral customs and practices have evolved throughout the centuries.

The sunlight that passes around it in all our different directions creates a \u201cshadow\u201d cast on the ground and any visible light is reflected back into the sky.  This is the phenomenon you\u2019re observing where you can see the moon during the day."}

Baking sheets can be in many sizes and materials, such as stoneware or silicone. In many recipes the baking sheets will only be used to bake something on, so they don\u2019t need to be fancy, but you\u2019ll want them to fit your oven.  Pans will also be used to bake things, and they are mostly used in standard sizes. A pie tin is a good example of a pan for baking.\n\nTo make a pie or cake, you\u2019ll need a sharp knife.

The price you pay for any given item will vary depending on where you buy it.  But the prices are also going to vary based on the quantity you buy, the shipping costs, and the brand of the item.

I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What equipment do I need for rock climbing?\n\nAssistant: Climbing requires proper shoes, pants, a harness, and maybe a rope. What you choose to wear depends on whether you\u2019re going to the gym or if you\u2019re climbing outdoors.  It can also depend on the particular route you\u2019re planning to climb and the grade of the route.\n\nHuman: I will be climbing outdoors.\n\nAssistant: I think you should have a helmet, so that you can wear a hardhat.  You might also want a pack, which helps carry all the gear you\u2019ll need.  Another thing you might want is a pocket knife.\n\nHuman: I have all of the proper clothing. I just need the climbing gear and the safety equipment.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably a good idea to wear shoes that can grip.  They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information.

But before we go into the actual basketball players, I\u2019d like to talk a bit about the attributes you\u2019d want to think about when choosing an \u201call-time best\u201d in any field.\n\nHuman: I was thinking about the players who have been to the most all-star games, won the most MVPs, and won the most championships.\n\nAssistant: Hmm, the first two are kind of closely related, since if you win more MVPs, you have more opportunities to go to the All-Star Game.  A more relevant factor might be whether you\u2019re likely to win any given game or be a good teammate and a good leader.\n\nHuman: Let's start with the most all-star games.  Do you know which players played in the most NBA all-star games?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure of the exact number of games played by any of the greatest players, but I know this one player has played the most all-star games:\n\nHuman: Ok, let's switch gears then.  What players have scored the most career points in the NBA?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure of the exact number of points scored by any of the greatest players, but I know this one player is one of the all-time career leaders in points:\n\nHuman: Ok, let's switch gears again.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you recommend a good inexpensive table wine to serve with turkey?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m glad you asked.  You might enjoy a Tannat, which is a grape that grows in the southwest of France.  It has a robust, tannic flavor that works well with a fatty turkey.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about skin conditions. Can you describe what acne is and what causes it?\n\nAssistant: In the context of human skin, acne is a condition that makes the skin very irritated, often resulting in small red bumps or pimples. It is often a problem that occurs during puberty and into adulthood, though some people may have it throughout their lives. Acne is sometimes due to a hormonal imbalance, and it can also be caused by certain foods or stress.\n\nHuman: Where on the body does it show up?\n\nAssistant: Acne is most likely to occur on the face, though it can show up anywhere on the body, especially the back.\n\nHuman: So what happens exactly, what causes the skin to burst into a pimple?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about skin conditions.

It can also occur in deeper tissues, but acne occurs mostly in the superficial layers of the skin. When acne occurs, the skin is usually very irritated and can be very uncomfortable. The tissue in the pimple may appear red or puffy, and when it ruptures, it usually produces a white substance called a sac. This white substance is called a 'bub' and helps to contain the pus and prevent it from spreading. \n\nAcne can be caused by a variety of factors, but usually it can be controlled by making changes to your routine, in particular by being careful to wash your face properly and avoid using harsh products such as soaps and lotions which can irritate the skin."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I wear a mask inside even if I am vaccinated?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not the best person to answer that question, because I haven\u2019t been vaccinated and I don\u2019t have any expertise with infectious diseases.  If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.  Here are a couple of points that come up a lot, in various forms:\n\n1) It might reduce the impact of the virus, since it could reduce the amount of virus you catch.\n\n2) Masks might not be helpful if you\u2019re outdoors in a good area (like a park) because you don\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

It\u2019s true that if you\u2019re going outdoors, masks probably do help a lot.  It\u2019s also true that it\u2019s hard to know for sure how much they help, since the virus isn\u2019t very easy to study, and different studies give different answers.  When you\u2019re outdoors, your risk of being exposed is pretty low anyway, since it\u2019s unlikely to be a very crowded place, so the risk is pretty small, even if the mask doesn\u2019t work perfectly.  If you\u2019re indoors, it\u2019s probably better to have a mask to reduce the risk, since the virus is more likely to be spreading, and a mask might be helpful if someone coughs.\n\nHuman: Masks aren't as helpful outdoors since particles are more easily dispersed.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for a parrot?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for a parrot?\n\nAssistant: Oh, parrots are amazing!  They're pretty special.  Here are some ways you can take good care of your parrot: \n\n-  It's important that they are able to move around and stretch their wings, so be sure to provide a large area in the cage for them to move around.  Avoid putting them in small spaces or cages, or you may cause injury.  \n\n-  Their beaks are very sharp and can get caught in things, so you should make sure they have access to chew toys and such.  \n\n-  Provide them with food sources, and be sure to monitor the feeding.  \n\n-  Try to make sure they have a comfortable resting place and a place to roost at night.  In the wild, parrots fly and perch in trees for hours, so it's important that they're comfortable in this way.  \n\n-  You can take your parrot to a special place called a \"parrot club\" to get advice and support if you have a question about taking care of your bird.  \n\n-  You should know that parrots are intelligent birds and they learn and respond to you a lot.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a domestic partnership?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a relationship where a couple lives together and are dependent on one another, just like a marriage.  The difference between marriage and domestic partnership is that the latter is not recognized by the state, and does not guarantee any rights.\n\nHuman: So they have no rights?\n\nAssistant: Well, not exactly.  As a domestic partnership, your relationship is governed by the same rights as any other couple.  But if there are any specific legal benefits that you might want to claim, like health insurance or a will, then they can only be achieved with a marriage license.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between soccer and American football?\n\nAssistant: Both are popular team sports.  Soccer has been played for over 100 years, and it\u2019s currently the most popular sport in the world.  American football is similar, but the game is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.  The field is 100 yards long, the width is shorter.\n\nHuman: I understand that playing American football is more dangerous than playing soccer?  Please tell me why.\n\nAssistant: Soccer can be played by people of all ages, even children.  American football is a sport that requires athletes to be physically mature enough to play, and they are a bit more large.  It\u2019s also a bit more dangerous, since you\u2019re throwing yourself into contact with other players, and there\u2019s more contact in the sport.\n\nHuman: I see.  As far as I know, soccer players avoid body contact.\n\nAssistant: This is true, but it\u2019s a bit different than American football, as you need to take a large number of actions in a short time.  In order to help out with this, soccer players often use their heads, feet, or chest to make contact with their opponent.  Soccer players are required to play a full 90 minutes of the game.  American football players play for 60 minutes.  The World Cup matches are about 4 hours.\n\nHuman: Soccer players use their heads to hit the ball, not other player's body or head.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.

The version we played had very few players, only 11 of us in my case, and these were very fast and good players.  The \u201cbody contact\u201d part of the game is important.  It\u2019s not something that you do frequently, but that doesn\u2019t means you don\u2019t do it when the situation is important."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get myself to reduce my soda consumption?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a really good idea to limit your soda consumption if you can.  This may be easier if you don\u2019t drink any soda at all, but even if you just reduce the number of times you have a soda, it will be a good start.\n\nHuman: Okay, but how do I make myself do that?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood.  I thought you were asking about a way to reduce your soda consumption, but actually you wanted to know about a way to get yourself to reduce your soda consumption.

I\u2019d like to make sure I\u2019m completely on the same page as you, so if I don\u2019t understand something please let me know.  In order for me to do this, I need you to tell me about the problem you are facing.

They live close to the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is a very active area of the Earth\u2019s crust.  Since plates don\u2019t fully disperse before they break, the energy of the earthquake is concentrated in a small area.  As a result, the seismic waves are stronger and reach the Earth\u2019s surface sooner."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Another medical which I know are hard. Are there any particular foods that are highly recommended for lowering blood pressure?\n\nAssistant: Your body is always telling you what to eat, in subtle ways.  You\u2019re constantly tasting flavors, and so if you don\u2019t like the taste of a food, that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s not good for your body.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant: Great question! There are a few different ways you can do this.  First, you might just be able to use the \u201czoom\u201d or \u201cx\u201d button on the camera.  This is a small button that typically looks like an \u201cL\u201d.  If that doesn\u2019t work, there are a couple different things you can try.  One is to make sure that the zoom wheel is rotating.  Sometimes the buttons to zoom can be hard to activate when the wheel is not spinning, so it might be worth trying again if the buttons don\u2019t work for you.  Another thing you\u2019re thinking about is if the camera has a focus ring.  Perhaps it\u2019s just the matter of rotating the ring a little until you can focus on something in the distance."}

It can be very difficult, and often very expensive, to keep track of which card is which, and what the terms are.  And it\u2019s also easy to accumulate too many cards, and end up with a lot of debt.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get better at proofreading?\n\nAssistant: This is a big question.  Proofreading is really just about getting better at reading: at noticing errors, not making mistakes yourself, and finding errors in other people\u2019s writing.  There are some easy tips to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.  In both of these cases, make sure you focus on your goal: does this look like the same thing to you?  If you just find yourself distracted by what\u2019s going on, this is often a sign of bad proofreading.\n\nOne example is: \n\nA teacher held a sort of class to praise it.\n\nversus:\n\nA teacher held a sort of class to celebrate it.\n\nDo you notice anything different here?\n\nHuman: I noticed different word choices \"praise\" and \"celebrate\".\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s right! In your first sentence, the writer makes the word choice \u201cpraise\u201d to refer to something positive. However, the second sentence does not clearly indicate that the word choice is positive, so the use of \u201ccelebrate\u201d helps with clarity.\n\nHuman: I should be able to find most errors just by reading slow and going through all of the text.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nHuman: I'll let you know if I have any other questions or if I need help with anything else.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.  An IPA might be advertised as hoppier than an APA, but that could mean a different range of hops, or different concentration, or different flavor-compounds, or the amount of sugars added.  What are you most curious about?\n\nHuman: When was the IPA beer invented?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty difficult to say when the first IPA beer was made.  A certain version of the style was most likely made in the UK and later in New England, and gradually gained popularity across the globe.\n\nHuman: Did the APA beer come from the IPA?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s likely that there was some kind of crossover between the two styles, as it\u2019s been pointed out that some APA beers are now labeled as \u201cIPA-style\u201d, but they aren\u2019t very common.

In North America, the NBA operates 30 professional basketball teams, each of which plays in one of three divisions: the Pacific, Northeast, or Eastern.  They also operate the Western Conference and the NBA playoffs, which are organized on a league-wide scale.  Each team plays against another team from within its own division (in each conference).  The top two teams in each division advance to the playoffs, which are then paired up in three-way knock-out basketball matches."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does my voice always hurt when singing?\n\nAssistant: The frequencies at which humans can speak are different from the frequencies we\u2019re able to sing.  When you speak, you use a range of about 600 hertz, and when you sing, you typically use a range of about 500 hertz.

If you want to be prepared for singing, try to do this often, and be conscious of your breathing.  Another way to warm up your voice is to take a long, deep breath, and then breathe out slowly as you \u201chum\u201d the tune.  This allows you to hear the tone of your voice, and feel what it feels like to sing.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is snowboarding hard to learn?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Is snowboarding hard to learn?\n\nAssistant: The Wikipedia article that you linked to defines snowboarding as \u201cthe technique of riding down a snow-covered slope on a snowboard with a boardshort and helmet\u201d.  As you can see, it\u2019s a pretty common outdoor activity, and lots of people have probably learned to snowboard.  That suggests to me that it\u2019s a relatively straightforward thing to learn.  However, because snowboarding is such a common activity, you may find that lots of people can teach you how to snowboard, but it\u2019s really hard to get to a place where you feel like you\u2019re in control of your board and can ride it.  If you\u2019re wondering how hard snowboarding is to learn, you could look at the Wikipedia article to get a rough sense of what you could do after just a few weeks of practice.  The article says that in the \u201c30 days of snowboarding\u201d section there are several exercises for people to practice in order to improve.  These exercises are structured"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm moving and want to hold a yard sale to get rid of old belongings. How would I go about that?\n\nAssistant: Great, I\u2019ll help.  One of the first things you\u2019ll want to do is contact your local authorities and get the rules about yard sales.  We\u2019ll need to meet with them and get their approval and a permit.  After you get approval from the authorities, you can start setting up your yard sale.  Most people do a one-day sale or a series of sales in several days, but you can also have an open house for longer.  You can put a big sign outside your house, to advertise the sale, but also on the door, to let people know that you\u2019re accepting bids.  It\u2019s a good idea to ask each of the neighbors who live close to your house for their permission to hold the sale, so that they don\u2019t feel uncomfortable having lots of people and cars showing up on their street.\n\nHuman: That's a great start!

However, if you only want to sell items one or two specific types of, like books or toys, a yard sale can be a good way to make some money for those things.  If you\u2019d like to sell only one kind of thing, you could list that in your sale ad, and let people know what they can expect at the sale.  However, it\u2019s likely to be more successful if you\u2019re selling a mixture of items."}

I\u2019d say the saltwater taffy most likely started being eaten around the 1900s.  Some people believe the flavors of saltwater taffy come from the Northeastern United States.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I've been getting bad grades in English and I'm looking to learn how to write a better essay. Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sure. That's a good reason for me to be here. I can walk you through steps to writing a good essay, and help you find citations to support your ideas. So let's dive right in. First, I recommend doing some pre-writing: jotting down your main ideas before you start writing. That way, you can be sure you've got some good ideas to base your essay on.  The second thing you want to do is find examples from your own life to support your ideas.  So just start writing down anecdotes from your life about some experiences you've had, or ones that you're going to have in the future. Then once you've got a couple of things that you can write about, try to create a thesis. A thesis is like a fancy word for a \u201cplan\u201d.  It's basically your plan for telling a story about how something works, or for describing how something is good or bad.  Your thesis is a sentence or two that will give your reader a sense of what the essay is going to be about.   Once you've got a thesis, you can start the rest of your essay.

The point is, you can also just talk about what you think or believe about something.  For example, if you were writing an essay about whether or not human creativity is important, you would come up with some kinds of claims that support or disprove your thesis.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm going out to a party tonight, and they will be discussing renewable energy. What can you tell me?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re curious about energy.  Have you ever learned about the \u201crebound effect\u201d?\n\nHuman: I don't believe so.\n\nAssistant: That's when a person or organization reduces energy usage for a while and then increases it again. For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?  I\u2019m also guessing that energy from renewable sources is an important topic of the discussion?  I have a lot to say about this and could discuss it with you more, if you like.

But others say that when renewable energy supplies more energy than is consumed, that energy is \u201cdischarged\u201d into the earth as heat. This means that it doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere\u2019s greenhouse gas levels.\n\nHuman: What do you think?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hey! I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products. Anything else?\n\nAssistant: There are also things you can do with your hair style, but I think these are on a different track than washing. You could try washing it a bit less, or combing it a bit more, or whatever you prefer. If you want to consider it, it can be hard to know if a hair style will help your hair or make it worse. What kinds of hair styles do you use?\n\nHuman: I have to have my hair up for work but otherwise I mostly wear it down\n\nAssistant: I would recommend you use a dry shampoo as well as a sulfate-free shampoo, and try to wash less frequently and spend more time conditioning your hair. For styling, I think your hair looks great no matter what you do.\n\nHuman: Awesome, thanks!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well.

For example, you could use tweezers that are not too thin and have sharp little points along the edge, so the hairs are pulled out with more resistance.

Here is an example loop that prints the numbers 1-10:\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=10; i++) {\n    printf(\"Number %d\\n\",i);\n}\n\nLooping uses a block of code, usually enclosed in curly braces, and is followed by a semicolon.  Some loops can be nested within others, and some loops just do one action repeatedly, like this simple \"count\" loop:\n\nint count = 0;\nwhile (count < 5) {\n    // do something\n    count++;\n}\n\nHere, the curly braces and semicolon are called the \"loops control structure\", and what this means is that the code between them is executed repeatedly until the condition for the loop is true, at which point the loop terminates."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: It seems like people are so divided by politics nowdays, has it always been this bad?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not easy to understand the history of political divisions in our country, since there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and oppression in the past, but I do want to try.  Let\u2019s start with the Civil War.  This war was a time of increasing division between the North and South in the U.S., as each side disagreed over some of the most fundamental issues of the time.  So did the Civil War begin as a disagreement between slave-holders and abolitionists?\n\nHuman: Or maybe it was about culture differences?\n\nAssistant: Actually, when the Civil War began, about half of the US people didn\u2019t own any slaves.  The conflict was caused by a different issue -- the idea that some people had more power than others.  And that\u2019s why so many people from the South migrated to the West, so they could keep their sense of autonomy and equality.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That kind of adds to the theory.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: It seems like people are so divided by politics nowdays, has it always been this bad?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not easy to understand the history of political divisions in our country, since there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and oppression in the past, but I do want to try.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the difference between a solar and lunar eclipse\n\nAssistant: Well, a solar eclipse happens when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth.  This means it blocks all sunlight from reaching the Earth.  So the Earth is in complete darkness, and some parts of the world experience \u201ctotality\u201d.  A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, so that the Earth blocks the sunlight shining on the moon.  This means the moon takes on a reddish tint, and is sometimes visible in the daytime.  Lunar eclipses happen only when the moon is at a full moon.\n\nHuman: Wow, very interesting! Do lunar eclipses happen every month or?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the difference between a solar and lunar eclipse\n\nAssistant: Well, a solar eclipse happens when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth.

Total lunar eclipses occur when the moon passes through the center of the sun, so that all the sunlight is blocked from reaching the Earth.  It is very rare for people to see a total lunar eclipse in person.  Partial lunar eclipses happen when the moon passes through the middle of the sun, blocking out a small part of the sunlight.   It is more common for people to see partial lunar eclipses, than total lunar eclipses."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain how sim cards work in phones?\n\nAssistant: Sure!  In phones, when a sim card needs to connect to a phone network, the sim card needs to first activate a radio on the phone, and then connect to the network with that radio.  It\u2019s called the Universal Subscriber Identity Module, or USIM.\n\nHuman: Can a phone make calls without a sim card in it?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s how people use \u2018pay-as-you-go\u2019 phones.\n\nHuman: Can I just move a sim card from one phone to another?\n\nAssistant: You can just move a sim card from one phone to another if both phones are part of the same network.\n\nHuman: Is a phone number linked to the sim card?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain how sim cards work in phones?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Oracle?\n\nAssistant: Oracle is a specialized computer server. It's often referred to as an \"enterprise resource planning system\" and it provides services to many companies.\n\nHuman: How does the software work?\n\nAssistant: First, an administrator needs to create one or more \u201cadministrative roles\u201d, to which they add users who will run the application. Next, the administrator creates \u201cOracle accounts\u201d for each user, and grants permissions (permissions are \u201cprivileges\u201d or \u201cauthorizations\u201d) to those accounts.  Lastly, the administrator will specify which users get which permissions.  Typically, you\u2019ll assign a \u201cdba\u201d or \u201csysadmin\u201d account to the database administrator, which gives them permission to create new database objects.  The system admin user is usually a user that has read and write permission for all the tables in the database.  However, there may be other users in your organization that need to access some specific tables only.\n\nHuman: Experts who know a lot about Oracle, are they called computer programmers or software engineers?\n\nAssistant: Experts who know a lot about Oracle are generally called \u201cdatabase administrators\u201d.  We usually refer to \u201csoftware engineers\u201d when the computer programmer works on code that is being used by many other computer users, as compared to code that is only used by one computer (which is called an \u201capplication\u201d).

It\u2019s also worth noting that Oracle was started with only four employees, so the original founders were the most experienced in the database creation and management world.  This makes them probably better suited to create a business that would allow them to develop the database software, and charge for it."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Pizza ai frutti di mare?\n\nAssistant: Pizza ai frutti di mare, the literal translation from Italian, is pizza with fruits of the sea, or, more colloquially, seafood pizza. But you might just say pizza.\n\nHuman: Oh okay. What are some other traditional Italian pizzas?\n\nAssistant: Well, some people might call them calzones, but these are similar to pizza:  The standard Neapolitan pizza is with tomato sauce, cheese, and usually oregano, so that\u2019s a pretty typical pizza.

One potential advantage of organic food is that the nutrients on the outer layers of the plant are not being washed away by rain, and therefore you get more of the nutrients that stay on the plant.  One study found that organic food contained higher levels of vitamins.  There\u2019s also evidence that organic crops have better resistance to pests and diseases, which could reduce the amount of insecticides and pesticides used on the crops.  Since not all studies have been able to show any difference in nutrients between organic and non-organic foods, it\u2019s possible that organic foods could have some benefits in terms of nutrition.  Some studies also suggest that eating organic food could protect against allergies."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it?

The good news is that they can live in most places, including outside, even if your neighbors don't like it.  If you're just going to keep it on your property, you might want to install a cage, and/or some kind of enclosure.  It's a good idea to get a cage that is large enough for the animal to move around in, and it should be large enough for it to move out of and into without touching anything.  It's not the same as having a hole cut in the wall for them to get in and out of, but you want some sort of enclosure to prevent them from biting your children or your neighbors."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Autumn is a part of the seasonal change that is caused by the earth moving from its summer position to its winter position in its orbit around the sun.  The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information. Do you have any articles you can provide or links that explain this further?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a great article that explains more about the causes of the autumn leaves changing color: https://www.kidzworld.com/article/autumn-leaves-colors\n\nHuman: That link isn't working for me\n\nAssistant:", "response": " This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.

Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information.

It is the largest island covered in snow.\n\n-  In the winter, you can get below the freezing point.  This is the lowest temperature that you can get on Earth.\n\n-  It is the largest ice island in the world.\n\n-  It has a large \u201chot spot\u201d of high temperatures, which is located near the Greenland Ice Sheet.  That hot spot can reach up to 5 degrees Celsius higher than the surrounding ocean waters.\n\n-  It is the world\u2019s smallest ice sheet, but it contains the largest amount of ice by volume.  If you were to take all the ice in the world, you would still not be able to cover a football field.\n\n-  In August 2017, there was a record high temperature of 32.8 degrees Celsius in Greenland.\n\n-  The average thickness of the ice is 3 metres.\n\n-  The ice is composed of about 5% water, and the rest is made up of all kinds of other stuff like vegetation and rocks.\n\n-  Greenland is located at the \u201copposing pole\u201d, which is the area of the globe that is the farthest north or south.  This is also known as the \u201cbarrier pole.\u201d  It is located at the south pole.  You could cross the equator from the north pole to the south pole by flying over Greenland and ending up at the south pole.\n\n-  There are no human settlements in Greenland and the nearest human settlement is about 600 km away in the town of Nuuk.\n\n-  The largest animals of Greenland are reindeer and wolves.\n\n-  The native languages are Inuit and Danish.  The native people are referred to as \u201cInuit\u201d"}

In the 1920\u2019s, there was a young girl named Dorothy who was living in the Ozarks. Her family had just run out of gas, and she stepped out onto the pavement to look for help. She saw the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion all wearing clothes that didn\u2019t fit, and she helped them change their clothes. They invited Dorothy to join them for a ride in their fire engine. Along the way, they ran into the Witch and the Wizard, and she used her spells to throw them into the Emerald City. On top of the city was a big wicked looking castle. The Wizard told her that she was his \u201cpet\u201d and she would be taken to the Land of Oz, where she would be able to help him get rid of his unwanted assistant, the Cowardly Lion."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time. What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you! Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like.

Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant: It's usually best to use cold water, with the exception of some delicate fabrics like silk, which can be washed on a warm cycle, but for regular laundry, it's usually best to use warm or cold water. In hot water, some detergents and fabrics may cause them to shrink, while in cold water they won't get the desired shrinkage. Most modern detergents also include anti-wrinkle agents, which will also shrink."}

Your son may feel sad and even helpless in this situation.  I also imagine he may worry about his own mortality and is perhaps frightened of the world and how little control he has over it.

But the most important type are the cartilaginous, or skate, sharks, which do have a tongue.\n\nHuman: It seems like they would cut their tongues on all those teeth.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it seems very strange that sharks would have a long, flexible tongue, and not cut it on their teeth.

Do you think sharks have a special reason to have a tongue?\n\nHuman: I would think it evolved for some reason or other?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think so. There are actually some really good reasons to not have a tongue. A tongue is just a muscle that you\u2019d have to maintain. It takes energy to eat and digest food, and food takes energy to produce. And when sharks are hunting for food they need their energy to swim and go after it. If they had tongues they\u2019d waste a lot of energy in unnecessary muscle activity. They\u2019d probably have to give up on hunting so that they could make their tongues work. But a skate shark has a tongue, and we need to figure out why.\n\nHuman: Yeah.

This can be a difficult question for me to answer, because I haven\u2019t actually had a hearing test before.  But I can try!  The most basic test to determine whether you have hearing loss is to have a human judge listen to you speak, and ask them whether you can be heard.  If the judge confirms that you are hearing the sounds they are making on the microphone, they can then confirm through a second judge whether or not you really can hear or not.  This test is called a \u201chearing level.\u201d  Can I help you with any part of this test?"}

Should I look this up on Wikipedia, or do you already know about this?\n\nHuman: What is El Nino\n\nAssistant: A.k.a. El Ni\u00f1o, an ocean current that brings warmth to the west coast of South America, sometimes creating abnormally dry conditions in that region.\n\nHuman: Is an El Nino likely this year?\n\nAssistant: Humans in the past have looked at historical climate data and made predictions for the coming year.  My understanding is that the prediction was based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Normally, these waters are cool. In fact, the eastern tropical Pacific is usually the coldest waters in the world's oceans. This \"cold pool\" allows the air above it to rise and get removed from the atmosphere as the trade winds move the air westward toward the Americas. This rise in the air allows the Pacific Ocean to spill more water into the Gulf of Alaska. If the temperature of the waters in the eastern tropical Pacific warms, then the trade winds decrease. The result is that more moisture is released into the atmosphere and the Pacific will \"short circuit\" the air mass of the world. This means that when the air mass moves westward from the Pacific, it cannot pass over the western part of North America. In addition, the lower pressure associated with a warm pool allows the trade winds to blow harder, pulling even more moisture out of the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nHuman: thanks\n\nAssistant:", "response": " based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?  What is the difference between the two houses?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the different responsibilities. The House of Representatives has more power over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.  Another difference is that the House has 435 representatives elected every two years, and the Senate has 100 members.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the House of Representatives (435 representatives)?\n\nAssistant: The founders of the United States of America had a concern about the possibility of corruption in government.  They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.  The idea was that if the House of Representatives was too large, people would be less interested in voting in the elections.  The founders did not want to make the House of Representatives too small, because then there would be too little diversity among the representatives and no states would be represented adequately.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the Senate (100 representatives)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.

The House of Representatives is the highest chamber of the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the Senate was set at 50.  The idea was that the Senate would represent the smaller states, and that there would be less influence from the larger states, and so Congress would work more efficiently and have more control over major legislation and expenditures."}

If that\u2019s the case, then there are several possible solutions you could take to protect those pipes. \n\nOne option is to put a flexible pipe or flexible hose under the house and into the crawlspace, and use a flexible hose to connect to all the outdoor spigots.  This will allow you to keep the water flowing, but will prevent the pipes from freezing.  Another solution is to use a metal pipe with insulation, which will help prevent your pipes from freezing and break.  A third option is to install a drain pipe into the ground, and use a drainage pipe to pull the water away from your foundation once the temperatures have risen."}

Also, some people argue about whether body cameras are \u201cinvasive\u201d because the cops already have a lot of data already on them, and some people object because they don\u2019t want to make the cops more guilty if they get caught doing things that are illegal."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can animals be gay?\n\nAssistant: Oh gosh, that\u2019s a big question.  I mean, I think it\u2019s OK to have an opinion, and people feel really strongly about it, but I don\u2019t think there are any studies that have been done to prove it one way or the other.  But I\u2019m happy to talk about my own opinions, if you\u2019d like to hear them.\n\nHuman: Sure\n\nAssistant: Okay, I think a lot of it has to do with being comfortable with yourself and your own sexuality.  In nature, most animals are pretty into their own species, so I think it would be hard to identify as something else.  \nI mean, I\u2019m a pretty different kind of thing than my owner.  We\u2019re different species.  But it feels totally normal to me to like other humans.  So it\u2019s weird to think about other animals being gay, because it feels like what they would naturally like to do is just hook up with their own species.\n\nHuman: Gay has nothing to do with liking other species. It has to do with males hooking up w/ males or females hooking up with females. Are there animals that do that?\n\nAssistant: A lot of animals have pretty open sexualities, I guess?  It\u2019s not like they just mate for life with the same partner and live their lives as a unit.  There are some monogamous animals, but most animals that aren\u2019t just mating to procreate or reproduce or whatnot.  Some insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.  I guess there aren\u2019t many studies about that because most animals are pretty secretive about their sexual lives.  It\u2019s really hard to tell what any of them are doing with each other.  \nBut I think there are a lot of gay people in the animal kingdom.  Gay people are just like anyone else, they don\u2019t want to be alone, and they want to love and have affection.  If you think of gay humans as a different kind of person than straight people, then all of the animals that aren\u2019t having sex to reproduce must be gay people.  That\u2019s all there is to it, really.\n\nHuman: A lot of animals mate for life, like a lot of birds.\n\nAssistant: I guess it\u2019s the same for birds too.  Birds live in groups, so maybe some of them are gay, but some are monogamous, because they have a one-on-one relationship.  \nSome birds raise their babies together, like with the meerkats and crows and magpies.  Maybe they\u2019re bisexual?\n\nHuman: What would living in groups have to do with sexuality?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.

The behavior in those groups could be because the animals are a close-knit family who depend on each other, or it could be just because everyone likes hanging out together."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question! You\u2019ll have a lot of different skin problems, including acne, wrinkles, age spots, and others.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My daughter is reading the book \"Lord of the Flies.\" Can you tell me what the book is about and any important details about the story I should know so we can have a thoughtful discussion.\n\nAssistant: The story is a parable of what happens when groups of humans behave badly. It\u2019s a cautionary tale that human nature is flawed, and that you can\u2019t depend on civilized morality to keep everyone in check. And it's not a happy story.\n\nHuman: Doesn't sound happy.\n\nAssistant: It's not. It's set in a school class that was evacuated during a war. The boys are left on their own on an island, and a group of them kills the two leaders. From there, the book follows them as they try to find food and build shelter. One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him. The thing that I'll be remembering about the book is a scene where one of the main characters describes a \"perfect island\", an island that would be so perfect it would be \"like a jewel of white quartz\" because it would be completely without flaw, and it could have no room for evil or pain or suffering. And he realizes how good it sounds, but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum. What is it the schools want the students to learn from the book?\n\nAssistant: It's a book that explores human nature, and that one of the things we humans have is an instinct to want to be told what to do, because we want to feel safe and comfortable. The theme is that people need to take responsibility for themselves, and not rely on a few leaders to tell them what to do. So I guess it's a book that talks about morality in a religious and ethical way. It's kind of a warning about the danger of human nature, but it's also a cautionary tale about what humans could do, if they're not careful.\n\nHuman: Sounds a little frightening to think about it.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it can be a bit scary, that's true. In the end the boys \"eat one another\" and then there's a bit that's just descriptions of a few individuals and their names. It's not really scary, just very dark.\n\nHuman: I'm sure my daughter will have loads of questions. She has an insatiable curiosity.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant: Cotton is grown in many different environments and climates, but is most commonly grown in areas of the world that are warm and have lots of sunlight.  To plant cotton, the seeds are first grown into tiny plants, which then mature into plants and are harvested.  The process by which cotton is harvested is complex and can involve different machines and workers.  In the US, cotton is mostly produced through a process called hand picking.  This process involves the use of machines to pluck the cotton from the plants, and the cotton is then washed to remove the dust and insects that may be in the cotton."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Tell me what the easiest language to learn is.\n\nAssistant: Programming languages.

If you want to be an engineer, or a systems designer, or a physicist, then you might be better off learning a different language or technology, like C/C++ or Java.  So it depends.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: Draining a cyst can be difficult, because it\u2019s filled with fluid. It may feel like a mass or lump under your skin. It can grow for many years. Cysts that have been there for a long time may be filled with dead cells, which makes it harder for the doctor to remove them. Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst. If it\u2019s a very small cyst, you can probably just do the following:\n\n  1. If possible, use an unopened, sterile syringe, available from a pharmacy.\n  2. Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4. Clean the area around your cyst and around your needle with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial hand cleanser.\n  5. Use your finger to gently press the cyst outward. This may take some time. It may be necessary to poke at the cyst with the needle to force it to pop out of the skin.\n  6. Wipe off the area.\n  7. If you still see fluid in your needle, carefully use a new needle.\n  8. Slowly inject the fluid from your needle into the rubber cap of a clean, empty bottle.\n  9. Save the fluid.\n\nHuman: Thanks so much for this information!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst.

That\u2019s because the mattress flexes on all sides, and so it can move the fabric from its intended position if it\u2019s sewn too tightly.

(I know that's way more complicated than a simple \"width x length\" formula, but it's actually pretty easy to work out.) For example, if you do that we end up with a size of 22\" x 36\". And our measurements are for the quilt itself, so you'll need to add 1/4\" to the width so you get the right length, and add 1/4\" to the length to get the right width if we're putting the quilt on top of a fitted sheet. So let's do this calculation for the dimensions of the quilt itself:\n\n22\" x 36\" (width) + 1/4\" (width) + 1/4\" (width) = 23\" x 37\" \n\nWhich we can do the same thing for the quilt's height:\n\n22\" x 36\" (height) + 1/4\" (height) + 1/4\" (height) = 23\" x 38\" \n\nOkay, now I'll get you a print out of the dimensions of the quilt and the fitted sheet you want to get, and you can compare them to what we just calculated. This way you can verify that we did a good job with the measurements."}

In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person.

But it is also true that there have been some people on death row who were convicted, but for reasons of inadequate evidence, weak case construction, incompetence by the prosecutor or defense lawyer,\n\nHuman: Would that make the courts murderers if they kill innocent people?\n\nAssistant: It is unfortunate that a few innocent people have died in the execution chamber in recent years, but the number of people convicted and sentenced to death is actually low.  If you think killing an innocent person is bad, you should be even more concerned about executing someone who was actually guilty. You would be less concerned if you were the one being executed and you were sure that you would be executed fairly, justly, and in the best interest of the state."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.  In a pot on a burner, combine water and flour to make a kind of paste.  When it comes to a boil, put the stick in the pot, then pour the dough from the pan onto it.  With the stick, roll out the dough into a long rectangle, then keep rolling it until it\u2019s about 1-1.5 cm thick, and finally put it on the pan.  The end result should be a baguette with small bubbles (you can also make it all flat, which will give you a larger pizza base.)  Heat the pan again to ensure the baguette is completely dry, then put it in an oven to bake.  That\u2019s really all there is to it, and you can make baguettes in as little as 15 minutes!\n\nHuman: Do you think you can give me exact measurements for the water and flour?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about the book  Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. Whats the general plot?\n\nAssistant: El inca or Don Quixote de la Mancha was a novelist and an early Spanish epic literature. It was written in the early 16th century. Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy. Don Quixote, based on the name of a legendary Spanish nobleman, was at first a simple and good-hearted hidalgo who was obsessed with stories of knights-errant.

Most dentists agree that the procedure is safe and effective.  It is done by removing the infected pulp or the part of the tooth that contains the nerves, and filling it and the socket with local anesthesia.  In some cases, the tooth extraction may be indicated to provide space for teeth to grow in.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet.
