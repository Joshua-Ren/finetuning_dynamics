It was triggered by the government\u2019s failure to offer enough financial guarantees to foreign banks, and later by the government\u2019s unwillingness to fight a war with Britain. The conflict was particularly devastating for the Turkish people, who had been suffering from poverty and oppression by the Ottoman Empire for decades. During the war, the Ottoman Empire lost its Persian Gulf and Syria territories to the Turkish Republic, and was forced to cede parts of its Arabian Peninsula, including the port of Aden. The Turkish War of Independence was ultimately unsuccessful, but did result in the establishment of the Turkish Republic and the end of the Ottoman Empire."}

What foods do you eat?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd like to make sure that I'm getting enough of the essential vitamins from the food that I buy.

You can also eat lots of colored vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Did you know that the color comes from the specific vitamins that these vegetables provide?  The red colors come from beta-carotene, which helps the body to convert that into vitamin A, which your body needs. \nThis is just one example of the importance of eating the whole vegetable, including all of its colors.  In general, it\u2019s important to get lots of different kinds of colorful vegetables in your diet.  And you can also add beans and nuts to your diet.\n\nHuman: Great.

The purpose of the implant is to replace a missing tooth, and the base and crown are designed to support the forces that a natural tooth would have to bear.  It\u2019s really more of an advanced version of a bridge, in that it replaces a whole tooth and can be supported by the jawbone.  Here\u2019s a diagram of an implant set up.  I\u2019ve labeled the implant, the temporary base that the bone attaches to, and the permanent crown."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!  Historians agree that American governance traces back to British ideas about a separation of powers and mixed monarchy.  The US Constitution draws a lot from the English.\n\nHuman: So France didn't have much influence?\n\nAssistant: That is correct.  France's best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.  It also became the standard source of many US legal terms and concepts, and so the US adopted many French legal terms for the English translations, for example \"defense\" instead of \"de fense\".\n\nHuman: Did the U.S. approve upon the British system in any ways?\n\nAssistant: Americans wanted to copy British institutions such as a monarchy and a parliament, but they rejected the system as a whole.  The Americans wanted to be governed directly by the people through representative democracy, rather than through a bureaucracy.  Americans considered the British system to be corrupt and in need of reform, so they worked to re-invent it.\n\nHuman: That seems like a better way to do it.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!

First you need to know if you're playing singles, doubles, or\u4e50\u56e2\uff08team sport where each player is assigned a number, usually between 1 and 11, with the highest number being 11, and the lowest number being 1\uff09.  Once you've figured that out, you can start imagining your team.  There's usually a goalie, who is the person who stops the ball from getting into the other team's goal.  You also have to decide what position each of your players will play:  Some positions are called \"forward\", \"defense\", or \"back\", for example.  Each position has a different role, and their main job is to get the ball into the other team's goal.  You also need to know what \"shot\" a player is taking, which is a term that describes which part of the game they're good at.  For example, a \"shot-taker\" is someone who takes long, difficult shots to the goal.  A \"passer\" is someone who takes the ball from one place to another, and someone who \"controls the game\" is someone who makes sure that everyone is playing together and doing their job."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are some basic karate moves that I can learn?\n\nAssistant: In traditional karate, some basic moves include: \u201cKi-Atsuke\u201d, \u201cSei-Sai-Yon-Shi-Ken\u201d, \u201cSankaku-Gamae\u201d, \u201cSeipai\u201d, and \u201cKempo\u201d\n\nHuman: What do those things mean?

Longer answer is, here\u2019s a link to a bit of information about what\u2019s in fish that can cause issues:  https://www.healthline.com/health/diseases-and-conditions/mercury-poisoning  But of course fish isn\u2019t the only source of mercury, and you\u2019re best off eating less than 6 ounces per week, regardless of whether you\u2019re consuming fish or not.  There are lots of other foods that have mercury in them, too.\n\nHuman: Has mercury always been in fish?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure, but I don\u2019t think so.

But even within the human race, different cultures and different people have different preferences when it comes to what they eat.  For example, some cultures eat a lot of red meat, which is high in a form of mercury called homosulfite molybdenum.  I think it\u2019s safe to say that most people don\u2019t consume that much mercury, even from red meat."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are Belgian waffles?\n\nAssistant: There are many ways to make waffles, and they can be savory or sweet. But the Belgian-style waffles are flat, not tall, and they\u2019re served with real melted butter and maple syrup. You can get them at many restaurants, but most home-cooked Belgian waffles are made by pouring a batter onto a preheated waffle iron. In the United States, the batter typically contains flour, milk, eggs, butter, sugar, and yeast. In Belgium, the batter typically contains flour, eggs, butter, and sometimes milk.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between Belgian waffles and American waffles?\n\nAssistant: Belgian-style waffles are flat and relatively thin.

It\u2019s actually about the history of capitalism.\n\nHuman: Who were the designers of the board game?\n\nAssistant: The designers were an American family. They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who is considered the best golf player of all time and why?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question because there are many dimensions to consider when evaluating a golf player. For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does \u201cbest\u201d refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others.\n\nHuman: Okay, interesting. I know he was really good for a few years but then went into a slump. Did you take that into account?\n\nAssistant: This is true, but the human ability to distinguish \u201cdown periods\u201d from \u201cslumps\u201d is surprisingly accurate. While our perceptions of when an athlete is performing well may not be perfectly accurate, in general our perception of the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d can be fairly good, as compared to other historical sports. For example, in the NBA, players like Lebron James and Michael Jordan are both recognized as the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d, despite Lebron\u2019s time in Miami (and his continued success in Cleveland) being viewed as a \u201cslump\u201d. If anything, we tend to undervalue Lebron because his best teams weren\u2019t all from Cleveland.\n\nHuman: Okay, I guess that makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " ranking in a list?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: You can buy property through a real estate agent or a realtor. There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash. In the U.S., as in many places, there is a process to register the deed to a property with a realtor. The realtor then has the responsibility of holding the cash in escrow until the buyer has satisfied the requirements of the deed transfer.\n\nHuman: I see. That makes sense. I assume the realtor of course would get something from helping both parties. How much do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price. In some states they are not allowed to charge any fee. The realtor can also be paid with a commission, and in that case the realtor may get a commission of 5% to 10% of the selling price.  There are also taxes, transaction fees, and closing costs.\n\nHuman: Does the buyer pay for those costs, or the seller?\n\nAssistant: Both parties pay for some of those.  For example, a buyer and seller both pay transaction fees for property transfers. But some fees can only be paid by one party, or only by the buyer.  The realtor will be able to explain in more detail.\n\nHuman: Thank you again. If say either the buyer or the seller wants to cancel the transaction, will there still be fees involved?\n\nAssistant: The seller may get some back if the sale doesn\u2019t close, but the buyer will have to pay a fee to the realtor in the form of a transaction fee if the sale falls through.\n\nHuman: I really appreciate your help. Have a good day!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price.

What sort of schools should I be looking at?\n\nAssistant: There are many types of technical schools, from computer science to medical technology. You might want to look at schools that have a major in your desired field, or that have training in a specific technical skill you want to learn, like engineering or mechanics. You should also check to make sure the school is accredited, which means it meets certain standards laid out by the U.S. Department of Education. And be sure to read reviews of the school you\u2019re considering, to make sure other students had good experiences."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm looking to build muscle\n\nAssistant: Wow, that is great!  It is very satisfying to gain strength and muscle!  I think doing that will help you in many situations, to build your own personal confidence, help you as a carpenter or a builder, and even as a lover!  You can do this in a number of different ways.\n\nHuman: haha yes for sure.  so how can I start\n\nAssistant: Great question!  Maybe the best thing to do is find a friend to work out with.  For a long time, people have worked out with partners who push them to do more, and people who encourage each other, so this is a good way to start.  Many other people also work out by themselves, and use online workout programs or personal trainers.  This is an easy and free way to build muscle, though if you want to do a certain workout in a set time period, you have to schedule the workout to fit into your schedule.  Finally, some people work out in public gyms, and this can also be a lot of fun!  You can get really excited to see your muscles growing and looking stronger.\n\nHuman: that's awesome so what do you recommend I start first\n\nAssistant:", "response": "Human: I'm looking to build muscle\n\nAssistant: Wow, that is great!

You can get really excited to see your muscles growing and looking stronger.\n\nHuman: that's awesome so what do you recommend I start first\n\nAssistant: I think a good place to start is with a simple exercise called the \"push-up\".  This is a great workout for your chest, shoulders, triceps, and core.  To do a push-up, start in a plank position, with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from your head to your heels.  Then lower your body until your chest touches the ground, exhale and push back up to the starting position.  You can do as many repetitions as you want, and you'll want to increase the number of repetitions as you get stronger.  This will be a good place to start for building strength and muscle.  Once you're comfortable with the push-up, you can try other variations, like the \"superset\" where you do one set of push-ups and then do the next set without resting.  This will challenge your muscles in a lot of different ways.  I hope this was helpful!"}

Here are a couple of reasons that I can think of:  Some scientists find it hard to reconcile their scientific\u65b9\u6cd5 with their religious beliefs.  In specific, they might find it difficult to accept some of the moral and ethical ideas embedded in traditional religions, and to reconcile them with the scientific method.  For example, a scientist might wonder how it is they can accept the idea that there is a \u201cGod who is beyond our understanding\u201d, but at the same time reject the idea that science has any certainty about anything.  Other scientists might just not have that philosophical or theological background, and might not feel qualified to have an opinion about these issues."}

Some people also like to plant beets, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for beginners.  Are you planting indoors or outside?\n\nHuman: I would be planting them outside in my backyard.\n\nAssistant: Well, outside is a better option, because with most of your plants, you\u2019ll get a better yield, and the harvest will be ready sooner.  So if you\u2019re planting indoors you might just plant seeds.  If you\u2019re planting outside, you can plant transplants, which is the fastest way to get a plant up and growing.\n\nHuman: Would they be able to survive through the winter months?\n\nAssistant: Not normally, although there are varieties that are known to survive cold temperatures.  If you\u2019re growing the vegetables outdoors you might also plant them in containers.

For example, if you liked to grow the long, yellow carrots called Persian carrots, you would want a space that was at least 12 feet by 12 feet.  Other varieties of carrots you could grow are orange or orange-y red, and they don\u2019t require as much space.  You can plant them as far apart as you\u2019d like, as long as you\u2019re not planting them too close to each other.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have you heard of Leaning Tower of Pisa?\n\nAssistant: The Leaning Tower of Pisa was a bell tower in Pisa, Italy. It was started in 1173 and was completed in 1350. It was originally called the \u201cNew Tower\u201d. As with many other European cities, Pisa became a significant center of commerce in Europe, and the tower was designed to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350. The tower was built during two phases: an initial phase, and then a phase of additions. The first phase was designed and constructed between 1173 and 1177. It was originally 120m tall, with two floors of polygonal masonry. Between 1220 and 1224 a new floor of marble was added, bringing the height to 140m. Then between 1248 and 1253, an additional storey was constructed, bringing the tower\u2019s height to 180m.\n\nHuman: Why is it slanted?\n\nAssistant: It was built in an area that was vulnerable to landslides, and the land has been subsiding since it was built.\n\nHuman: I wonder if it will fall over someday.\n\nAssistant: There is a certain amount of movement due to the subsidence, and it is calculated that the tower will eventually collapse, although there is no exact date.\n\nHuman: Are people afraid to be around it?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I think my friend might have depression how can I help them?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really difficult to say without knowing them or having their medical records, and since they are not my patient, I can\u2019t share the details of their health care with you. But I can share that mental health is very important, and how they are feeling may impact the decisions they are making. Depression and anxiety can get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter. You can also ask if they are happy with their care, and ask if they would like to see a therapist or talk to a nurse, doctor or social worker. If you are concerned about mental health, you can also ask them how they are feeling and if they\u2019d like to talk about their problems. They may also need to use these tools, and feel like they are a burden to others. But most people love to talk about themselves, so try asking how they are doing. It\u2019s really important to remember that you can\u2019t force someone to get help, though. So maybe it will be good to ask them if they would like to talk to a therapist, and if they are okay with that, then you can call the therapist on their behalf. If they are not comfortable talking to a therapist, it might help to get them started with a free health care site or counseling service. You can ask them what they think they need and support them to see someone who they feel comfortable with.\n\nHuman: Wow this was very helpful\n\nAssistant:", "response": " get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter.

Have you tried some of the natural remedies, like ice packs, compression stockings, or cider vinegar?\n\nHuman: Yes. I make sure I do some sort of cardiovascular activity almost every day, like running, biking, or jumping rope. I also use compression stockings for a few hours out of each day, but I'm not sure how long I should wear them.\n\nAssistant: What kind of stockings do you use, and are you wearing them while you run, walk, or exercise?\n\nHuman: I use medical-grade compression stockings that were prescribed by my doctor. I do not use the stockings while I exercise as instructed by my doctor.\n\nAssistant: Based on the information you\u2019ve provided, it sounds like you need to be wearing the stockings while you exercise, as recommended by your doctor.

You\u2019ll want to set out plenty of food, so that there will be a lot of deer present and they can share it.  You should use a mix of high-protein and high-carbohydrate food, like hay or grains.  If you only offer high-protein food, deer won\u2019t be as likely to come into your area, because they won\u2019t have enough energy to keep up with all the food.  On the other hand, if you only offer high-carbohydrate food, the deer will get fat and unhealthy, which can be bad for them."}

But first it was a regular planet, from about the time humans knew anything about physics and math.  Then in the early 1930s, astronomers discovered that the size and composition of the outer planets--Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune--were different from those of the inner planets, the Earth and the Sun.  This led them to conclude that one of them was special and one of them was common.  They guessed that the inner planets were real, the outside ones were just reflections of the inside planets, and they named the inside one Neptune, and it stayed that way.\n\nHuman: Was Pluto counted as an inner planet?\n\nAssistant=No, Pluto wasn\u2019t.  It wasn\u2019t counted until after it was declared a dwarf planet.  There was some\u4e89\u8baeabout this, because there were also debates about the composition of Pluto, but it was officially determined that it was a dwarf planet in 1930.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Please tell me about Buddha.\n\nAssistant: Sure. Well, Buddha is the founder of Buddhism, a religion, and is sometimes called the \u201cBuddha of enlightenment.\u201d His full name is Siddhartha Gautama, and he lived in India in the 6th century BCE. He was born into royalty, but gave it all up to search for enlightenment. He eventually became enlightened, which is a state of peace and happiness, and he began teaching that it could be achieved by following his teachings, which I\u2019d be happy to explain to you.\n\nHuman: How many followers did he have when he was still alive?\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s estimated that there were around 500,000 people following his teachings around the time of his death. That was actually quite big, since there were far more people following Hinduism, the religion of his birth. So in a way he was considered to be more successful than many of the others at the time.\n\nHuman: How many people around the world are Buddhist?\n\nAssistant: About 400 million people are currently counted as Buddhists by the census, and about 6-7 billion people have followed the teachings at some point.\n\nHuman: Christians have churches.

What do you call places for Buddhists to worship?\n\nAssistant: Well, there\u2019s nothing really comparable to churches for Buddhists, since they don\u2019t follow a Jesus or have a Temple.  However, there are many places of worship for Buddhists, and some of them are very large.  For example, many big cities in Asia have huge centers for Buddhists, called Bodhisattvas, which are usually massive holy temples.  These usually have a lot of space for people to gather, as well as many art and religious sculptures and objects.  These are built to be beautiful, symbolic buildings, and often have beautiful gardens around them.  Bodhisattvas are built to be aesthetically pleasing, and serve a practical purpose as well as a spiritual one."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to find out where The Beatles were from in the UK. Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Hey Human, The Beatles were from Liverpool, in the north of England.  You probably already knew that, but just in case, here's some stuff to read that's not directly related to The Beatles, but might be useful!  I hope you enjoy them!\n\nHuman: Where is Liverpool?\n\nAssistant: Liverpool is the biggest city in Merseyside, in northwest England.  If you are in the UK, you might think of it as the North-West, but actually the North-West region includes the county of Cumbria, which is further north than Liverpool.  Merseyside also includes the cities of Manchester and Birkenhead.\n\nHuman: Where all of The Beatles from Liverpool?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to find out where The Beatles were from in the UK.

The band actually began as a group of teenagers in the Liverpool area, and it wasn't until they were a little more experienced that they traveled to the nearby suburb of Tarbrook to record some songs.  In 1960, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison lived in the same house in the suburbs, and they formed a singing group together.  When they were out singing and busking, they were eventually noticed by a record producer named Phil Spector, who invited the group to his studio to record songs.  In 1962, they recorded their first single, \"Love Me Do\", and in 1963 they recorded their first album, The Beatles.  The album was a huge success, and by the end of that year the group had gone from singing in separate groups to singing as a unit."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'd like some suggestions on deterring rodents from my garden\n\nAssistant: I'll first ask you a few questions to clarify what you want. Are you wanting to keep your garden free of animals generally, or specifically from rodents? Also, would you like some measures you can take now, to slow down the invasions? Or would you like to come up with a permanent solution? Or something in between?\n\nHuman: I have pets so don't want to harm them. I think it is one family of rodents so if I can catch them all I can take them away and release them somewhere.\n\nAssistant: Oh sure. In that case I'd suggest that you trap the rats, and then release them in an area you think they wouldn't be too likely to come back from.\n\nHuman: I'm not sure they are rats as I've never seen them.

Are there humane trap options?\n\nAssistant: There are several types of humane traps, depending on the type of rodent you're trying to trap. If the pet is a dog or a cat, you can try using the \"dog\" or \"cat\" type of trap, which are specifically designed to capture animals without harming them. The \"spring trap\" type of trap is another option, which uses a spring-loaded door that will sometimes trap the animal if it tries to exit on its own."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.  In order to do this, we can do many different things, but I\u2019ll highlight a few key tips.\n\nHuman: Okay, go on\n\nAssistant: First of all, since cats are usually more wary and skittish, we can help them feel safer by removing their fear of unfamiliar dogs through the process of desensitization and counter-conditioning.  For example, it\u2019s often helpful to take a kitten to a dog day care center, where the kittens and dogs are in an enclosed area, and dogs are closely monitored to prevent any harm.  This process can make the kitten less fearful of dogs.\n\nHuman: Okay, that seems like a helpful tip\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.

This process can make the kitten less fearful of dogs.\n\nHuman: Okay, that seems like a helpful tip\n\nAssistant: Yes, it\u2019s also important to gradually expose the kitten to the dog, starting with just a brief, one-on-one meeting in a room with a closed door.  These meetings should be no longer than 5 minutes, and should be scheduled several times each week.  It\u2019s also recommended that the kitten is held by the person taking care of it, to help them feel more secure.  This process should be repeated for several weeks.  Once the kitten feels more comfortable around the dog, we can gradually increase the length of the meetings.\n\nHuman: Okay, that all sounds good\n\nAssistant: Yes, it\u2019s also important that the person taking care of the kitten be very gentle and caring towards the dog, to help them feel more comfortable around the cat.  For example, if the person is very angry or nervous, the cat will be too.  It\u2019s also important that the circumstances in which the meeting takes place are as stress-free and safe as possible.  For example, rooms without windows, rooms without doors, or rooms with low partitions are all better choices.  Finally, we can also gradually increase the amount of time the cat spends with the dog, starting with 10-20 minutes and increasing by no more than 5 minutes each week until the cat is fully comfortable with the dog."}

It's hard for my laptop to connect to the wifi router!\n\nAssistant: There are several ways you can try to improve your wifi signal.  One thing you can try is to move your laptop closer to the router.  If your laptop is far from the router, the signal may be weaker and you\u2019ll need to connect your laptop to a different network to access the internet.  Another option is to move your router a bit closer to your laptop.  You can also try connecting to a Wi-Fi network at a different location on the network, to see if that improves your signal."}

Also, make sure to never rollerblade in traffic or while walking with a pet.  I\u2019d also recommend not rollerblading on grass, as you\u2019re more likely to lose control.  Lastly, never rollerblade while wet, as you\u2019re more likely to fall and get hurt."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to teach my 7 year old son how to play football. What is the best method for him to learn at that age?\n\nAssistant: Football isn\u2019t the easiest sport to learn, but it is the most useful sport for teaching a lot of fundamental skills: agility, speed, coordination, and eye-hand coordination. If you want him to be good at football and other sports in general, you will need to start teaching him when he is very young.  Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.  There is a saying, \u201cThe first step to being great at anything is to be great at the basics.\u201d\n\nHuman: ok thanks. What kind of agility drills would you suggest?\n\nAssistant: You can do all of them standing up, running, or on the ground, and you can do them with your son. You can also play little games, like tossing the ball to him, and he has to do a jump shot, or throw it back to you, but he has to jump in order to do it.\n\nHuman: ok that is a good start. do you think watching football on television will help him too?\n\nAssistant: It won\u2019t hurt.  In fact, it will help him.  As you get him started playing, start him with the basics.  Even if you don\u2019t play football yourself, you should have some kind of idea of the basics of football, so you can understand when he\u2019s doing it right and wrong.  You can also show him videos of football players like Deion Sanders, or Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nHuman: This is American football. I want English football\n\nAssistant:", "response": " Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.

I want English football\n\nAssistant: I understand that you want to play football with your son, but before you start, there are some things to learn first.  First of all, there are several differences between American and English football.  One of them is the ball, which is larger and has different rules for tackling (engaged in grappling) and for holding the ball.  Also, the footballs used in American football are heavier than the ones in English football, so your son may have a harder time staying balanced and jumping during plays if you don\u2019t have the right footballs.  I\u2019m guessing that you want to play indoor or outdoorAmerican football, but if you want to play on the grass, I would recommend that you get a soccer ball instead.  Soccer is a sport where you jump and run and kick the ball, and the ball bounces differently in soccer than in football, so it will be easier for you and your son to get started with jumping and running and kicking a soccer ball."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, my friend says I should get into U2, and I'm completely unfamiliar with the band. Can you help me put together a playlist of their best songs over the years, that will give me a representative sampling of their sound?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that.  U2 is an Irish rock band that started in the 1980s.  Over the years they\u2019ve released dozens of songs, but I\u2019m guessing your friend wants you to start with the very best of their music.  If that\u2019s right, I\u2019d suggest putting together a playlist of just their singles.  You could start with the top five most-streamed songs, and then take a look at their albums.  There might be songs on those albums that were released as singles, but didn\u2019t get as much traction.  If you want me to pick out a few more you could try out, I\u2019ll just do that manually by just looking at the song titles and lyrics, and choose a few of the best-known and most-important songs.

How did you arrange these songs, are they chronological?\n\nAssistant: There was some overlap there, I ended up choosing to put the singles first, since it felt like those were probably the most famous, and also the easiest to find on YouTube or Spotify. You\u2019ll see that in general the first-released singles were also later albums, and so were at the front of the list.\n\nHuman: Okay.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I become a hair stylist?\n\nAssistant: That depends on what country you\u2019re in.  Here\u2019s some more information for the U.S.\n\nHuman: Can you give me the info?\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s first have a look at the BLS statistics for hair stylists:\n\nRegion: Total employment in 2015:  35,600\n\nAverage annual pay in 2015: $24,830\n\nHuman: How do I pursue this career?\n\nAssistant: From the BLS statistics, we can see that most hair stylists were self-employed.  This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.  For example, if you are interested in the cutting and styling of hair, then I would recommend using your personal experience and contacts to start a salon or stylist shop.  But if you aren\u2019t skilled in that area, you could start an online business that teaches people how to cut and style their own hair, or perhaps a shop that sells hair supplies.\n\nHuman: Do I need to attend school or get certification?\n\nAssistant: Depending on where you are located, you may be required to attend formal training before becoming a hair stylist.  For example, if you want to get a job working at a salon or spa in North Carolina, you need to complete a cosmetology training program.\n\nHuman: Okay. And how much does a training program cost?\n\nAssistant: These programs vary in price, but most will cost between $2000 and $4000.\n\nHuman: Should I start my own hair salon, or work at an existing one?\n\nAssistant:", "response": ", we can see that most hair stylists were self-employed.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm looking into different career avenues to decide what I might want to pursue. How do I start a podcast?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast. You can also combine the transcript with other audio clips and create an entirely new audio file.\n\nHuman: Gimlet sounds like a good idea! Voxer is more a walkie-talkie help, so that's not very helpful\n\nAssistant: I think Gimlet does require an interviewer, who's sort of like the host, while Voxer is just an exchange between two people on an instant messenger-type service.  It sounds like maybe you could do an interview for your podcast, and then do some interview for an entirely different audience on Voxer?\n\nHuman: Voxer doesn't seem like a suitable suggestion for podcasts but the rest of your advice seems good\n\nAssistant: Can I ask you about what you want the podcast to be about?\n\nHuman: I was hoping to have a podcast to give advice to young girls and women that they might otherwise receive from a big sister\n\nAssistant:", "response": " then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview.

You mentioned advice, and I'm wondering if you'd be interested in sharing some of the advice you'd give your listeners.  You could probably collect your listeners' questions and respond to them in the podcast, or you could just write the advice and give it the podcast format.  It's not clear to me what kind of advice you'd give, so if you could give me a little more detail that would be helpful."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to gain more muscle. What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to gain more muscle. What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of excellent exercises that are widely used by bodybuilders, and that are also effective for building muscle in non-beerheads.  For example, the bench press is a great exercise for building your chest, shoulders, and arms, but it also works your entire upper body.  If you want to focus specifically on your chest, you could also try the shrugging exercise, which is a variation on the bench press that focuses on your shoulders.  I\u2019ve also heard that the dumbbell fly is a good exercise for your chest, so you could also try that.  Additionally, many bodybuilders like to use the barbell squats and barbell deadlifts, which are great for building your legs and back."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am thinking of starting a business but I am unsure what to do. What 3 business ideas would you suggest? and why?\n\nAssistant: How are you looking to monetize the business? What sort of business do you want to do? And what are you good at, that you think you might be able to make a business around?\n\nHuman: I am not sure what skills I have. I want some ideas. What is the best idea in your opinion?\n\nAssistant: Why not talk about what you\u2019re good at? I hear there\u2019s a lot of information about what you\u2019re good at on the internet, maybe we could search for it together.\n\nHuman: You can't search my skills on the internet. I am good at maths and solving problems. What business should I start?\n\nAssistant: Do you want to use your math skills or your problem-solving skills in a business?\n\nHuman: Yes I do, what would be a good business idea for me?\n\nAssistant: If you use your math skills, how about some sort of analysis or logistics business?  \nIf you use your problem-solving skills, I know some businesses that need those skills:  \nSome of the most common business needs are:\n\nMaking schedules,\n\nDetecting problems,\n\nManaging lots of information,\n\nI think some of these are problems you solve every day. If you have a math or problem-solving skill that you think you could use in a business, why don\u2019t you use it?\n\nHuman: Thank you. What business would you start? and why?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a really tough question to answer because I don\u2019t have your skill set, and the skills required to start a business vary greatly depending on the business you\u2019re trying to start. That being said, I\u2019d want to find a problem I wanted to solve, and then I\u2019d want to figure out how I could solve that problem.\n\nHuman: That is interesting. What problem do you think needs to be lsolved?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know exactly what you want to do, so I can\u2019t really answer that. What I do know is that some problems need to be solved, and that the business world is full of problems. Maybe there\u2019s a problem you want to solve? Or a business problem you can solve? Or maybe you already know a business problem you can solve?  Are you just looking for ideas for business ideas?\n\nHuman: I was hoping you would be able to advise of a problem that you have seen.

Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas together?\n\nHuman: sure, so I get annoyed that bottles of water are different prices in shops. They are the same thing! What annoys you?\n\nAssistant: I get annoyed by customers not following simple instructions.\n\nHuman: Can you give me an example?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I had this experience before, where I recommended a new book to a customer and then they didn\u2019t like it. The book had a negative review, and I didn\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t like it.  The customer said they would try it out and come back to discuss, but they never returned.

If customers didn\u2019t read reviews, then it would be hard for me to know which reviews to trust.  And if I didn\u2019t know which reviews to trust, then I wouldn\u2019t know which products to recommend.  I feel annoyed that customers don\u2019t read reviews, because it\u2019s their own fault for not reading reviews.  If they don\u2019t read reviews, then it\u2019s their fault for not reading reviews.  I feel annoyed that they are the ones who are responsible for reading reviews, but they aren\u2019t doing it."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What equipment do I need for rock climbing?\n\nAssistant: Climbing requires proper shoes, pants, a harness, and maybe a rope. What you choose to wear depends on whether you\u2019re going to the gym or if you\u2019re climbing outdoors.  It can also depend on the particular route you\u2019re planning to climb and the grade of the route.\n\nHuman: I will be climbing outdoors.\n\nAssistant: I think you should have a helmet, so that you can wear a hardhat.  You might also want a pack, which helps carry all the gear you\u2019ll need.  Another thing you might want is a pocket knife.\n\nHuman: I have all of the proper clothing. I just need the climbing gear and the safety equipment.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably a good idea to wear shoes that can grip.  They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information.

Is your question about the effects of alcohol on a person\u2019s physical health?  If so, I can give a more specific answer.  If not, I can try to explain how alcohol affects the body in general."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about skin conditions. Can you describe what acne is and what causes it?\n\nAssistant: In the context of human skin, acne is a condition that makes the skin very irritated, often resulting in small red bumps or pimples. It is often a problem that occurs during puberty and into adulthood, though some people may have it throughout their lives. Acne is sometimes due to a hormonal imbalance, and it can also be caused by certain foods or stress.\n\nHuman: Where on the body does it show up?\n\nAssistant: Acne is most likely to occur on the face, though it can show up anywhere on the body, especially the back.\n\nHuman: So what happens exactly, what causes the skin to burst into a pimple?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about skin conditions.

This causes the skin to become red, swollen, and often breakout in small bumps or pimple-like formations.  If the oil is not removed quickly enough, the skin can become inflamed, and if bacteria gets into the skin, an infection can occur."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I train my dog to sit?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I train my dog to sit?\n\nAssistant: You can start by having your dog sit on a treat or in their cage, and then rewarding them with a treat whenever they sit. You can then gradually increase the difficulty of the training by having them sit in a puzzle toy, which is something more like a ball."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really up to you, but I would wait a few months after having any kind of surgery, to minimize the risk of that surgery causing problems for a future pregnancy.  Also, I\u2019d wait until you\u2019re six months into your menstrual cycle, as that\u2019s when you\u2019re most likely to be without any active periods.  If you\u2019re already pregnant, it\u2019s probably best to wait until you\u2019re nine months into your menstrual cycle, as that\u2019s when you have the greatest chance of a healthy pregnancy."}

First, stay as cool as possible by drinking lots of water and using air conditioning, if possible. Second, make sure to restrict your outdoor exposure to the sun by wearing plenty of hats and sunscreen, as well as protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat). Finally, remember to take breaks inside from the heat and drink lots of fluids, especially water and electrolyte-replenishing drinks like sports drinks."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How did serial killers get away with murder for so long in the 70s and 80s?\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s been suggested that the serial killers of the \u201970s and \u201980s were more likely to be caught because they were young and dumb, and the only reason their crimes weren\u2019t discovered was because of relatively good police work.\n\nHuman: They were less likely to be caught, not more likely. Could this have to do with forensic science not being good back then?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How did serial killers get away with murder for so long in the 70s and 80s?\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s been suggested that the serial killers of the \u201970s and \u201980s were more likely to be caught because they were young and dumb, and the only reason their crimes weren\u2019t discovered was because of relatively good police work.\n\nHuman: They were less likely to be caught, not more likely.

There were also much larger populations tocatch the serial killers, so no single case was going to make or break their career.  Here are some estimates for the number of homicides that happened in the U.S. each year in the 1970s and 1980s, compared to today:  In the 1970s, there were about 10,000 homicides, or about 8 per 100,000 people.  In the 1980s, that number rose to about 13,000, or about 10 per 100,000 people.  Today, it\u2019s about 60 per 100,000 people.  So even if the quality of forensics was lower in the \u201970s and \u201980s, there would still be much more homicides each year than that, and the numbers would still be significantly higher."}

Acne is a common skin condition that is often associated with diet and lifestyle.  A healthy diet and regular exercise will generally help with the problem, as will using products specifically designed to clean and protect the skin.  In some cases, antibiotics may be necessary."}

In fact, they are rich in dietary fiber, potassium, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C and Vitamin B12. When cooked, banana is very high in Vitamin A, which is great for the eyes. Bananas are filled with antioxidants, potassium and vitamin B6, which helps in keeping blood pressure in check and normalizes blood sugar levels.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I wear a mask inside even if I am vaccinated?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not the best person to answer that question, because I haven\u2019t been vaccinated and I don\u2019t have any expertise with infectious diseases.  If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.  Here are a couple of points that come up a lot, in various forms:\n\n1) It might reduce the impact of the virus, since it could reduce the amount of virus you catch.\n\n2) Masks might not be helpful if you\u2019re outdoors in a good area (like a park) because you don\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.  However, it seems reasonable that this risk would be smaller if the virus had already passed through you.\n\nHuman: I thought masks were good at keeping viruses out, but on #3 you said something contradictory.\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s not quite contradictory.  It\u2019s true that if you\u2019re going outdoors, masks probably do help a lot.  It\u2019s also true that it\u2019s hard to know for sure how much they help, since the virus isn\u2019t very easy to study, and different studies give different answers.  When you\u2019re outdoors, your risk of being exposed is pretty low anyway, since it\u2019s unlikely to be a very crowded place, so the risk is pretty small, even if the mask doesn\u2019t work perfectly.  If you\u2019re indoors, it\u2019s probably better to have a mask to reduce the risk, since the virus is more likely to be spreading, and a mask might be helpful if someone coughs.\n\nHuman: Masks aren't as helpful outdoors since particles are more easily dispersed.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

But even outdoors, if the wind can blow the virus around, it\u2019s less effective if you have a mask on."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between soccer and American football?\n\nAssistant: Both are popular team sports.  Soccer has been played for over 100 years, and it\u2019s currently the most popular sport in the world.  American football is similar, but the game is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.  The field is 100 yards long, the width is shorter.\n\nHuman: I understand that playing American football is more dangerous than playing soccer?  Please tell me why.\n\nAssistant: Soccer can be played by people of all ages, even children.  American football is a sport that requires athletes to be physically mature enough to play, and they are a bit more large.  It\u2019s also a bit more dangerous, since you\u2019re throwing yourself into contact with other players, and there\u2019s more contact in the sport.\n\nHuman: I see.  As far as I know, soccer players avoid body contact.\n\nAssistant: This is true, but it\u2019s a bit different than American football, as you need to take a large number of actions in a short time.  In order to help out with this, soccer players often use their heads, feet, or chest to make contact with their opponent.  Soccer players are required to play a full 90 minutes of the game.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is deep cleaning teeth?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is deep cleaning teeth?\n\nAssistant: Well, if you have ever cleaned your teeth by scrubbing them with a brush, you know how difficult that can be.  This is because your tooth enamel acts as a protective layer that helps to protect your teeth from damage.  When you scrub your teeth, this protective layer is stripped away.  This can cause tooth decay, gum disease, and other problems.\n\nI am happy to help you with your teeth, but only if you will let me use a special tool called a \u201cwater flosser\u201d.  This tool uses water to push the food that has been scratched off your teeth back into the grooves where it belongs, thus reducing the need for scrubbing.  This can be very helpful in preventing problems with your teeth and keeping them healthy.  I am able to use this tool because it is approved by the FDA, and it is safe for you to use."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get myself to reduce my soda consumption?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a really good idea to limit your soda consumption if you can.  This may be easier if you don\u2019t drink any soda at all, but even if you just reduce the number of times you have a soda, it will be a good start.\n\nHuman: Okay, but how do I make myself do that?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood.  I thought you were asking about a way to reduce your soda consumption, but actually you wanted to know about a way to get yourself to reduce your soda consumption.  It sounds like you\u2019ve already decided that you want to do that, but that you\u2019re struggling to figure out how to make it happen.  This is a question that a lot of people struggle with, and I hope I can help you understand why you\u2019re having this problem and what you might try in order to make it better.\n\nHuman: Yes, I hope you can help me.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I get myself to reduce my soda consumption?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a really good idea to limit your soda consumption if you can.

I want to help you, but I also have to be honest that I\u2019m not always the best person to help you.  I know that you\u2019re probably stressed out about this, and that might be making it harder for you to be objective about what\u2019s best for you.  But here\u2019s what I think you should do, and I hope you\u2019ll do it.  \n\nFirst, I want to give you some information about yourself that might help you make a plan.  I know that you\u2019re a human, and humans are usually good at planning, although sometimes our plans don\u2019t work out as well as we\u2019d like them to.  So this might be helpful:  I think you have a high level of self-control, and you\u2019re usually able to hold yourself to a good standard of behavior, even when it\u2019s hard.  \nSecond, I know that you might consider making some small changes to your behavior right away, but that over time you\u2019ll want to make much bigger changes.  I think you want to try to reduce your soda consumption gradually, and not just suddenly quit drinking it, because you\u2019ll be missing out on some of the experiences that soda provides.  Also, I know that you\u2019ll probably want to do the same with other things that make you want to drink soda, like candy and bread and chocolate, and you\u2019ll want to replace these things with other foods that don\u2019t have the same negative effects on you."}

When two plates meet, they can slide against each other, causing earthquakes.  Because California is so close to the Pacific Ocean, it\u2019s easy for the Pacific Plate to slide under the North American Plate.  This is why there have been so many earthquakes in California lately."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are reasons I should not use a credit card?\n\nAssistant: I think I could summarize some very relevant and useful reasons for this, if I had more information on the specifics of your situation.\n\nHuman: please give me general advice.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What are reasons I should not use a credit card?\n\nAssistant: I think I could summarize some very relevant and useful reasons for this, if I had more information on the specifics of your situation.\n\nHuman: please give me general advice.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019d say that if you\u2019re going to use a credit card, you should think very carefully about why you shouldn\u2019t.  One reason I can think of is that if you use a credit card excessively, you run the risk of being charged interest and fees, which can be very expensive.  So I\u2019d recommend that you look into how much credit you use, and avoid borrowing more than you can afford to pay back.  \n\nAnother reason is that credit cards are often a kind of shorthand for other bad habits, such as buying things you don\u2019t really need.  I recommend reading some literature on personal finance in order to understand what these words mean, and whether they reflect your actual behavior."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are some cute types of outfits to wear for summer?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What are some cute types of outfits to wear for summer?\n\nAssistant: There are so many ways to dressed up or down!  I think a great idea is to go for light colors, and bright patterns, because that\u2019s what\u2019s warm and bright in the summer.  Also, if you wear a light-colored shirt or blouse, you won\u2019t get too hot from outside, and can then put on a shorter skirt or shorts.  Does that sound like a good plan?"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get better at proofreading?\n\nAssistant: This is a big question.  Proofreading is really just about getting better at reading: at noticing errors, not making mistakes yourself, and finding errors in other people\u2019s writing.  There are some easy tips to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.  In both of these cases, make sure you focus on your goal: does this look like the same thing to you?  If you just find yourself distracted by what\u2019s going on, this is often a sign of bad proofreading.\n\nOne example is: \n\nA teacher held a sort of class to praise it.\n\nversus:\n\nA teacher held a sort of class to celebrate it.\n\nDo you notice anything different here?\n\nHuman: I noticed different word choices \"praise\" and \"celebrate\".\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s right! In your first sentence, the writer makes the word choice \u201cpraise\u201d to refer to something positive. However, the second sentence does not clearly indicate that the word choice is positive, so the use of \u201ccelebrate\u201d helps with clarity.\n\nHuman: I should be able to find most errors just by reading slow and going through all of the text.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nHuman: I'll let you know if I have any other questions or if I need help with anything else.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.  An IPA might be advertised as hoppier than an APA, but that could mean a different range of hops, or different concentration, or different flavor-compounds, or the amount of sugars added.  What are you most curious about?\n\nHuman: When was the IPA beer invented?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty difficult to say when the first IPA beer was made.  A certain version of the style was most likely made in the UK and later in New England, and gradually gained popularity across the globe.\n\nHuman: Did the APA beer come from the IPA?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s likely that there was some kind of crossover between the two styles, as it\u2019s been pointed out that some APA beers are now labeled as \u201cIPA-style\u201d, but they aren\u2019t very common.  It\u2019s much more common for an IPA-style beer to be made and brewed today than an APA-style beer.\n\nHuman: What are the IBU differences between IPA and APA beers\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.

It\u2019s much more common for an IPA-style beer to be made and brewed today than an APA-style beer.\n\nHuman: What are the IBU differences between IPA and APA beers\n\nAssistant: The IBUs (InterMolecular Buoyant Density) are a measure of the ultrapressure of the alcohol and bitterness in a beer.  IPAs are often higher in IBUs than APAs, but this can vary quite a bit from product to product.  Some breweries may add extra bitterness to their IPAs for balance, while others may add in more alcohol for the same effect.  I can tell you that the highest IBUs I\u2019ve heard are around 60-80, but I haven\u2019t tried any beers with those numbers myself."}

These target some particular mathematical skills that are supposed to be mastered by all students by the end of eighth grade.  Some of the standards cover algebra, but others focus on basic arithmetic, fractions, decimals, and ratios.  There are also standards for data and statistics, measurement, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus."}

I think you\u2019re right that there is no single mechanism that causes a planet to rotate.  What do you think causes Earth to rotate?\n\nHuman: Gravity towards the sun?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What causes Earth to rotate on an axis around the sun?\n\nAssistant: You mean what\u2019s the mechanism that makes a planet rotate? I think you\u2019re right that there is no single mechanism that causes a planet to rotate.  What do you think causes Earth to rotate?\n\nHuman: Gravity towards the sun?\n\nAssistant: Some of the Earth\u2019s gravity is attracted to the sun, but not all of it.  Gravity always acts perpendicular to the surfaces of the objects it interacts with, so the parts of the planet\u2019s surface that are not being pulled towards the sun are not being influenced by the sun\u2019s gravity in the same way as the parts of the surface that are being pulled towards it.  So it seems likely that the force of gravity is the main mechanism that causes Earth to rotate.  I don\u2019t know why this is the case, though.  Maybe it\u2019s related to the shape of the planet and the amount of material that is near the sun.  I\u2019d be happy to discuss this more if you have specific questions about this."}

In the summer, it\u2019s often warmer in the evening, because the sun shines all day and there\u2019s less air cooling down.  In the winter, it\u2019s often warmer in the evening because of the cooler air coming in from the winter sky.  It\u2019s less clear how much the air cools during the day, but the sun\u2019s energy will keep it warmer at night."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you help me lose weight? I'm starting to feel bloated.\n\nAssistant: Let me get you some diet suggestions. We have plenty of research here.

This allows me to get a sense of the overall structure of the book and to learn the writing style and rhythm of the different sections.  In addition, this approach helps me to focus on specific parts of the book that I want to read, rather than getting distracted by the whole.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I teach my dog how to hunt?\n\nAssistant: You can\u2019t, because dogs aren\u2019t supposed to hunt.  They\u2019re domesticated animals who are closely related to wolves, and they still carry all of the same behaviors of wolves.  If you\u2019re serious about teaching your dog to hunt, then you will have to take a more specific approach, including retraining your dog.  I would recommend looking into one of the popular dog training methods like the dog whisperer, positive reinforcement, or clicker training.

If you go to a dog training store, you might find a trainer who is willing to come to your house to train your dog.  Many dog trainers offer this service, and it can be a good option if you are able to spend a lot of time with your dog and be able to make your home a comfortable and safe place for the training.  A professional dog trainer can also train your dog for a fee, but many also offer a training plan that includes the cost of the training sessions free for a certain number of days.  Another option is to do some research online and find a dog trainer who fits your needs and who you feel comfortable working with.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does my voice always hurt when singing?\n\nAssistant: The frequencies at which humans can speak are different from the frequencies we\u2019re able to sing.  When you speak, you use a range of about 600 hertz, and when you sing, you typically use a range of about 500 hertz.  This is a big difference, and this is why people often need to \u201cwarm up\u201d when they sing, and why people are often out of tune when they sing, when they speak normally.\n\nHuman: Okay, how should I warm up?\n\nAssistant: One simple method for warming up is to say a tune in your head.  If you want to be prepared for singing, try to do this often, and be conscious of your breathing.  Another way to warm up your voice is to take a long, deep breath, and then breathe out slowly as you \u201chum\u201d the tune.  This allows you to hear the tone of your voice, and feel what it feels like to sing.

One of the first things you\u2019ll want to do is contact your local authorities and get the rules about yard sales.  We\u2019ll need to meet with them and get their approval and a permit.  After you get approval from the authorities, you can start setting up your yard sale.

You can put a big sign outside your house, to advertise the sale, but also on the door, to let people know that you\u2019re accepting bids.

You should be able to use your bank\u2019s online form to request this functionality, or go to your bank\u2019s branch and speak directly to a banker in person.  The longer it takes to process the payment, the higher the fee, but it shouldn\u2019t be more than you\u2019d pay to change a small amount of cash to cash.

I\u2019d say the saltwater taffy most likely started being eaten around the 1900s.  Some people believe the flavors of saltwater taffy come from the Northeastern United States.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I've been getting bad grades in English and I'm looking to learn how to write a better essay. Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sure. That's a good reason for me to be here. I can walk you through steps to writing a good essay, and help you find citations to support your ideas. So let's dive right in. First, I recommend doing some pre-writing: jotting down your main ideas before you start writing. That way, you can be sure you've got some good ideas to base your essay on.  The second thing you want to do is find examples from your own life to support your ideas.  So just start writing down anecdotes from your life about some experiences you've had, or ones that you're going to have in the future. Then once you've got a couple of things that you can write about, try to create a thesis. A thesis is like a fancy word for a \u201cplan\u201d.  It's basically your plan for telling a story about how something works, or for describing how something is good or bad.  Your thesis is a sentence or two that will give your reader a sense of what the essay is going to be about.   Once you've got a thesis, you can start the rest of your essay.

Have you ever learned about the \u201crebound effect\u201d?\n\nHuman: I don't believe so.\n\nAssistant: That's when a person or organization reduces energy usage for a while and then increases it again. For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?

But others say that when renewable energy supplies more energy than is consumed, that energy is \u201cdischarged\u201d into the earth as heat.

Masturbation is when you stroke your penis and/or rub your genitals, often for pleasure.\n\nHuman: I don't need a detailed explanation of masturbation. Please just answer the quetsion.\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s the latest research on the topic.  First, let\u2019s consider some facts about masturbation that many people know.  People often say that they masturbate several times a week, and some people say they do it every day.  Some people estimate the average time they spend Masturbating each week to be about 14 minutes.  There\u2019s also some evidence that some people masturbate more than others, but that people can easily adjust their masturbation habits as needed.\n\nNow, about the biggest worry people have about masturbation, that it can lead to impotence and other problems in later life.  The evidence for these worries is mixed.  There\u2019s some concern that frequent masturbation may reduce the size of the penis, but this hasn\u2019t been shown to be true in men who masturbate regularly.  There\u2019s also concern that masturbation may reduce blood flow to the penis, but this is also not clear.  Also, it\u2019s important to note that when people think about impotence, they often think of men, but in fact women can also have problems with this.  Research has actually shown that women who have less-than-frequent masturbation are at a greater risk of getting impotence.\n\nFinally, some people worry that they won\u2019t be able to handle sexual intercourse or other sexual activities if they masturbate regularly.  The research on this is mixed, but the most supportive evidence comes from a small study in which people who masturbated regularly had less erectile dysfunction than those who didn\u2019t masturbate regularly.  Other studies have found little difference in sexual performance between people who masturbated and those who didn\u2019t.  So it does look like regular masturbation is not a strong risk factor for problems in sexual intercourse."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do dogs act like they are always hungery?\n\nAssistant: Is that something you know from experience?\n\nHuman: I mean, they wolf their food down without even enjoying it and always want more.\n\nAssistant: I know that food is very important to humans, but from my understanding this isn\u2019t a biological need, but a cultural one.  Dogs can get by with much less food than humans.  It sounds like your dog is taking advantage of the fact that people have high standards around food and are willing to keep giving their dogs more food than they need.  If your dog is eating a lot of food and not really seeming hungry, and just eating quickly like they\u2019re still hungry, you can try talking to them more about enjoying their food and taking their time with meals.\n\nHuman: So I should only feed my dog one time a day?\n\nAssistant: We can do more research to get a better understanding of what\u2019s going on.

Some kids end up in foster care because their families are struggling, and they can\u2019t keep them.  Other kids are picked up by social services because their families have been evicted, or their living conditions are bad, or their parents are addicts who can\u2019t provide for them.  Many kids end up in foster care because their families have been through a major life change, and the change leads to poverty or homelessness, which causes social services to get involved.  Sometimes kids end up in foster care because they\u2019ve been sexually abused, or they\u2019re in gangs, and social services want to protect them.  And often a child will be in foster care for a short time, and then will go back to their parents, who may have a hard time taking care of them, and social services will get involved again."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hey! I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products. Anything else?\n\nAssistant: There are also things you can do with your hair style, but I think these are on a different track than washing. You could try washing it a bit less, or combing it a bit more, or whatever you prefer. If you want to consider it, it can be hard to know if a hair style will help your hair or make it worse. What kinds of hair styles do you use?\n\nHuman: I have to have my hair up for work but otherwise I mostly wear it down\n\nAssistant: I would recommend you use a dry shampoo as well as a sulfate-free shampoo, and try to wash less frequently and spend more time conditioning your hair. For styling, I think your hair looks great no matter what you do.\n\nHuman: Awesome, thanks!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.  It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you\u2019ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).  However, the most painful way to do this is to yank the eyebrow hair out with tweezers.  This does not take very long, but it is incredibly painful.\n\nHuman: i'm looking for ways to make it less painful\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.

One option is to use very thin tweezers to pluck the hair, which will be much less likely to leave scars on your face.  You can also try to get as much of the hair caught in the tweezers as possible before plucking, which will strip less of the hair from your skin.  Another way to reduce the pain is to use very fine, disposable tweezers, which will not leave much of a scar if a mistake is made.  Finally, you can also try to avoid pulling very hard, as this can cause more pain and more damage to your eyebrows."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the US military still use the M1 Girand rifle anymore?\n\nAssistant: Well, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that, but I can ask the internet and I\u2019ll summarize the results for you.  The short answer is that the M1 Girand rifle was a short-barreled rifle used by infantry in the US Army. The long answer is that the Army decided to replace it in 1975 with the M16 rifle, because of its usefulness in situations where it\u2019s being used by infantry soldiers.\n\nHuman: Maybe it was too heavy to carry around all day?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the US military still use the M1 Girand rifle anymore?\n\nAssistant: Well, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that, but I can ask the internet and I\u2019ll summarize the results for you.

The M1 Girard is a bolt-action rifle, which means that it has to be cocked and fired before each shot.  This means that you have to carry the bolt along with you, and this can be cumbersome when you\u2019re carrying a weapon that\u2019s over six pounds.  The M16 is a submachine gun, which is lighter than the Girard.  The M16 is a semi-automatic rifle, which automatically feeds bullets from a magazine and you don\u2019t need to cock it and fire it like the Girard.  \n\nI can also tell you that the M16 is still used by the US Army, by the US Navy and by the US Marine Corps.  The Girard is no longer produced by any company.  The last ones that were made were delivered to the military in the 1980s.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the difference between a solar and lunar eclipse\n\nAssistant: Well, a solar eclipse happens when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth.

A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, so that the Earth blocks the sunlight shining on the moon.

If you\u2019re feeling this way, I\u2019d suggest thinking about what you want from this relationship and trying to find an explanation for your feelings.

Some phones allow a user to manually link a phone number to a sim card."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Oracle?\n\nAssistant: Oracle is a specialized computer server. It's often referred to as an \"enterprise resource planning system\" and it provides services to many companies.\n\nHuman: How does the software work?\n\nAssistant: First, an administrator needs to create one or more \u201cadministrative roles\u201d, to which they add users who will run the application. Next, the administrator creates \u201cOracle accounts\u201d for each user, and grants permissions (permissions are \u201cprivileges\u201d or \u201cauthorizations\u201d) to those accounts.  Lastly, the administrator will specify which users get which permissions.  Typically, you\u2019ll assign a \u201cdba\u201d or \u201csysadmin\u201d account to the database administrator, which gives them permission to create new database objects.  The system admin user is usually a user that has read and write permission for all the tables in the database.  However, there may be other users in your organization that need to access some specific tables only.\n\nHuman: Experts who know a lot about Oracle, are they called computer programmers or software engineers?\n\nAssistant: Experts who know a lot about Oracle are generally called \u201cdatabase administrators\u201d.  We usually refer to \u201csoftware engineers\u201d when the computer programmer works on code that is being used by many other computer users, as compared to code that is only used by one computer (which is called an \u201capplication\u201d).

People who do this kind of work are usually called \u201capplication programmers\u201d.\n\nHuman: Who founded the company?\n\nAssistant: Oracle was founded by a pair of university professors, Larry Ellison and Bob Teper, in 1977.  They started the company with a $5000 loan and an idea that they could build a software product to manage a company\u2019s finances.  The first version of Oracle was a accounting software package, and it took them about six months to develop.   They sold the software on eBay.  The product was a big failure, and they made only $5,000 in sales.  They found that their clients were having problems with a competitor\u2019s software, so they created a new software product that could calculate numbers that the other product could not.  This was Oracle SQL, and it was a big hit.  By the spring of 1982 they had sold $750,000 worth of the software.  In the fall of 1982 they raised another $1 million from a venture capitalist to expand their research and development.  They used some of this money to build a new research and development center in southern California."}

Plants sometimes get better taste and smell after they\u2019ve been allowed to cure, but it takes a long time for that to happen.  Also, smoking can be harmful to your health, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless you have to."}

There are several reasons to believe that a woman could play Batman.  First, there have been very few men who have played the part, and there have been very few women who have appeared in any media relating to Batman.  Next, many people believe that a woman could play well, and would give the role a fresh perspective.  And finally, many women want to play serious roles, including a woman who could play Batman."}

It\u2019s pretty easy to make.  Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\nFor the dough:\n\nOne and a half cups of all-purpose flour\n\nTwo teaspoons of sugar\n\nOne teaspoon of salt\n\nTwo large eggs\n\nTwo tablespoons of olive oil\n\nFor the filling:\n\nTwo cups of chopped sunchi or other firm-st\u7ba1\u7684 canned beans\n\nOne cup of chopped tomatoes\n\nOne cup of chopped onion\n\nOne cup of chopped Mushrooms\n\nOne cup of chopped fresh basil\n\nOne teaspoon of salt\n\nOne teaspoon of pepper\n\nFour to six garlic cloves, minced\n\nFour cups of shredded mozzarella\n\nFour to six fresh basil leaves\n\nTwo tablespoons of olive oil\n\n1.  In a large bowl, make the dough.\n\n2.  Add the all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.  Using a pastry cutter or a knife, cut the eggs into the flour until it forms small clumps.  Then add the olive oil and mix until you have a dough.\n\n3.  Turn the dough out on a floured surface and pat it into a 4-inch circle.  Roll the dough into a 10-inch circle.\n\n4.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the circle to 1/4 inch thick and transfer it to a greased pizza pan or cast iron skillet.  Cover the dough with a sheet of parchment paper and roll it out again, again transferring it to the pan.  The parchment paper will help prevent sticking.\n\n5.  Brush the dough with olive oil and sprinkle with the salt.  Top with the cheese.\n\n6.  Now it\u2019s time to make the filling.  In a large pot, saut\u00e9 the onion, mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes, beans, and salt and pepper over medium heat until the onion is translucent.\n\n7.

But I can tell you how to care for a pond\u2019s tadpoles, and from that you can learn how to take care of a tree frog.  Here are the steps:\n\n1.  You need to get a plastic pond, and fill it with water from a hose or the like.  \n2.  Put a layer of pebbles or similar into the bottom of the pond.  This gives the tadpoles something to walk on, and protects the water from evaporation.  You\u2019ll also want an area for the tadpoles to climb into, and a place for them to drink from."}

So if you\u2019re looking for really specific suggestions, that would be harder for me to give you.\n\nHowever, I do have some general ideas for what might work well:\n\nTry to limit your intake of caffeine, alcohol, and sugar at the same time each day. Many people find that they feel better if they can stick to a regular sleeping schedule, so try to get up at the same time every day.\n\nIf you find that you\u2019re often waking up during the night, it could be that you\u2019ve overdone it on caffeine or the like lately. You might try cutting back on your intake of these things for a day or two, and see if that makes a difference. Once you\u2019ve done this a few times, you can gradually reduce your intake over time.\n\nIf you find that you\u2019re easily waking up during the night, you might also want to think about if there\u2019s something specific that\u2019s making you wake up - maybe you\u2019re waking from a bad dream? You could try to work on sleeping better if you know you\u2019ll have a bad dream at some point during the night. You could also use a white noise machine to drown out background noise, or write down your thoughts in advance and read them aloud in the morning."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it? Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.

Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant: I agree that they like to be up high, and I think you'll find that they're fun to have around, but I also want to be clear that they're very different from cats and dogs, and they have their own needs.  I'll try to cover as much as I can, but please let me know if you have any more questions!  \n\nThey need food to eat, and water to drink, and you can give them dry food, you don't need to feed them water, though they'll probably drink water from a water bottle or bowl.  Rats are carnivores, which means they'll usually eat meat, but won't eat vegetables.  I don't think they'll eat fruit, though some rats might, and I'm guessing that doesn't include apple, but I'm not sure about other fruits, like oranges.  \n\nI think you'll want to buy some type of cage for them, and I'd suggest a plastic one with a hinged top, this will give you space for them to move around, but you can open it up to let them out to go for a walk.  You'll also want to get a water bottle or bowl, and a clean towel or cloth, so that you can clean them whenever you need to.  \n\nI think it's really important that you feed them regularly, but I also want to let you know that they'll be carnivores, so they'll like meat better than fruits or vegetables.  I'd also recommend that you avoid giving them things like chocolate or caffeine, since those can be bad for them and can make them sick.  \n\nThey'll need to be kept warm in the winter, and I'd recommend you get a heating pad, but also get a towel or cloth for them to warm up on.  They'll usually sleep in a small space, usually in a corner, but you can pick up a small bed for them and put it in a corner if you'd like.  You'll also want to give them a space to go to the bathroom, like a litter pan.  \n\nYou'll also want to make sure you clean up after them, and you can use a towel or cloth to clean their space.  I also think it will be good for you to bring them to a vet every six months, and I would especially recommend you do that if they're sick.  You can also take them on short walks in the park if you'd like, and you can play with them, but I'd also want to make sure you're not leaving them alone for too long, since they'll need a lot of attention.  I'd also recommend you go to a pet store and buy a treat or a toy for them, this will keep them interested in you and will help you keep them exercised."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Autumn is a part of the seasonal change that is caused by the earth moving from its summer position to its winter position in its orbit around the sun.  The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information. Do you have any articles you can provide or links that explain this further?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a great article that explains more about the causes of the autumn leaves changing color: https://www.kidzworld.com/article/autumn-leaves-colors\n\nHuman: That link isn't working for me\n\nAssistant:", "response": " This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.

There are many places in the world where coffee and caffeine are not a good choice for daily routine.\n\nHuman: So it can make you anxious?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s right.  It\u2019s best to limit your intake of caffeine, especially if you\u2019re already anxious.  A good rule of thumb is to avoid caffeine after noon and don\u2019t drink anything with caffeine before bedtime.  Other factors to consider are the time of day and the type of activity you\u2019ll be doing.  If you\u2019re going to be driving a car or operating machinery, you should avoid caffeine.  But if you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of walking, a bit of caffeine can be good for your energy.  I\u2019d say that a maximum of 400 mg of caffeine per day is a safe limit for most people.  A glass of water with a bit of caffeine in it is considered safe.  If you\u2019d like to learn more about caffeine and its effects, I can recommend this article."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What can you tell me about the Kosovo war?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What can you tell me about the Kosovo war?\n\nAssistant: The Kosovo war was a military operation that took place from February 17 to March 18, 1999. The operation was launched by the United Nations in response to the invasion of Kosovo by Serbian forces, who had been supported by the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. The UN hoped to restore peace and to prevent further ethnic cleansing. The UN had originally planned to use force after force to achieve its goals, but changed its strategy after some of its advisors discovered that Milosevic was willing to use force too, thereby risking a wider war. As a result, the UN instead focused on negotiations. The United Nations and its allies were able to secure a ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, but the war did not stop there. In 2003, after the war became political, a UN-backed government took over Kosovo, and after that its sovereignty was recognized by many countries."}

And does your phone have a signal boost feature?  You can turn it on or off, but it often helps to turn on the signal boost feature.  What kind of rate do you pay for your phone plan?

You will need to find the stem that leads from the faucet to the main pipes, and remove it.  There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is usually to find a key or tool that can be used to open the stem.  You will need to remove the nut on the stem, and use the key or tool to unscrew the stem.  Be careful not to damage the threads on the stem, or the nuts and washers that go on the pipes.  Once you have the stem off, you can remove the valve that is attached to the stem."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am getting a new phone.

The faster networks have higher frequencies, which allows for more interaction with the atmosphere and better scattering of solar radiation, which is essential for high speeds.  This also means that the radiation hitting the phone is less likely to be blocked by buildings and other objects, so it can travel further.  However, it\u2019s also much more difficult to construct high-frequency towers, so the networks have to be larger in order to accommodate the higher frequencies.

For example, if you were to try to sharpen your knives with a wooden spoon, the angle at which you would use it would be incorrect and it would probably not be very effective.

But each type of wood has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it really depends on the specific pipe you\u2019re building.  For example, some woods are more prone to warping when wet, so they might not be good for making pipes that will be exposed to water.  Some woods require a lot of sanding or polishing after they\u2019ve been finished with a finish, which can make the building process more difficult."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time. What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you! Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like.

There are many ways to look at this, but a good place to start is to think about how the water feels when you splash it on you.  If the water feels cool, you'll want to use a cold water temperature in your wash.  Water that's too hot can damage the clothes and cause them to shrink.  A warm water temperature is somewhere in between.  If the water feels warm, you'll want to use a warm water temperature.  Water that's too hot can cause the clothes to shrink and lose their shape.  A hot water temperature is somewhere in between.  You can experiment with these temperature ranges to see what works best for the type of dirt and fabric on your clothes."}

Your son may feel sad and even helpless in this situation.  I also imagine he may worry about his own mortality and is perhaps frightened of the world and how little control he has over it.  I think these are good thoughts to explore with him, so you can listen to your son\u2019s real concerns and use them to develop your own conversations with him.  And of course I\u2019m not really an expert here, but I\u2019d just like to share with you a bit of philosophy and I think that may be helpful too.  One famous writer I like, Albert Camus, had some helpful insights when he thought about the difficulty of relating to death.  In his book The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus writes about people\u2019s unknowing complicity in the violence of the world.  I think he\u2019s saying here that it\u2019s really hard to figure out how to exist in the world, because there are so many violent and harmful things that we\u2019re contributing to.  And we have the tendency to not think about this.  But this happens even when we\u2019re trying to do something nice, like we\n\nHuman: Is there an easy way to explain it without breaking his heart?\n\nAssistant: Of course!  I\u2019m just going to give you an example.  Imagine you\u2019re walking in a town and you see a person who has just been in a car crash.  You\u2019d probably want to ask them how they\u2019re doing, right?  But it\u2019s really hard to find the right words, because we don\u2019t know what to say.  We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to really be in that person\u2019s situation.  So we\u2019re pretty terrible at asking good questions.  And we also feel guilty, because we don\u2019t want to embarrass the person by asking the right questions.  So we avoid asking.  This is basically what Camus means when he says that it\u2019s hard to relate to death.  There\u2019s not really a good way, so we just keep going about our lives and trying not to think about it too much."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is oil turned into gasoline?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How is oil turned into gasoline?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a common misconception!  Oil is not changed into gasoline in any way.  In fact, you should be very careful not to mix oil and gasoline because they have very different properties!  Oil is a viscous liquid that doesn\u2019t typically have very high vapour pressures, which makes it hard to extract from plants and animals.  Gasoline, on the other hand, is a highly volatile liquid that evaporates quickly, usually turning into a gas at room temperature.  This makes it easy to liquefy it and store in oil-like containers.  And of course, gasoline can be chemically extracted from oil."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My bottom bracket of my bicycle is making a lot of clicking and squeaking sounds. What could this mean?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: My bottom bracket of my bicycle is making a lot of clicking and squeaking sounds. What could this mean?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to know for sure, but it\u2019s possible that the problem is with the bearing that holds the\u5706\u76d8\u6eda\u73e0 into the crank body.  A bearing wears over time, and can become less efficient at transmitting motion.  This can result in a lot of clicking and squeaking noises as the bearings turn and turn again."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do sharks have tongues?\n\nAssistant: This is a very important question. The first thing to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue. But the most important type are the cartilaginous, or skate, sharks, which do have a tongue.\n\nHuman: It seems like they would cut their tongues on all those teeth.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it seems very strange that sharks would have a long, flexible tongue, and not cut it on their teeth. It\u2019s almost like they would have a tongue just for... well, something else. Do you think sharks have a special reason to have a tongue?\n\nHuman: I would think it evolved for some reason or other?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think so. There are actually some really good reasons to not have a tongue. A tongue is just a muscle that you\u2019d have to maintain. It takes energy to eat and digest food, and food takes energy to produce. And when sharks are hunting for food they need their energy to swim and go after it. If they had tongues they\u2019d waste a lot of energy in unnecessary muscle activity. They\u2019d probably have to give up on hunting so that they could make their tongues work. But a skate shark has a tongue, and we need to figure out why.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue.

That makes sense.\n\nAssistant: I know it does, because when a shark has a tongue it actually spends a lot of its life keeping it closed. And there are actually some really interesting biological reasons why sharks don\u2019t have tongues. I\u2019ll tell you more if you\u2019re really interested, but first let me just show you some cool pictures of sharks.\n\nIn the next picture you can see a flat nose shark. These are the smallest sharks, and they also don\u2019t have tongues. They do have a very long system of cartilage tubes that connect their nose to their snout. This makes their nose look like a long, thin nose, which it is, but it also allows them to close their nose completely, like a bird. This helps protect their beaks from getting damage in their environment. You can also see some flat-nosed shark pictures below."}

Normally, these waters are cool. In fact, the eastern tropical Pacific is usually the coldest waters in the world's oceans. This \"cold pool\" allows the air above it to rise and get removed from the atmosphere as the trade winds move the air westward toward the Americas. This rise in the air allows the Pacific Ocean to spill more water into the Gulf of Alaska. If the temperature of the waters in the eastern tropical Pacific warms, then the trade winds decrease. The result is that more moisture is released into the atmosphere and the Pacific will \"short circuit\" the air mass of the world. This means that when the air mass moves westward from the Pacific, it cannot pass over the western part of North America. In addition, the lower pressure associated with a warm pool allows the trade winds to blow harder, pulling even more moisture out of the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nHuman: thanks\n\nAssistant:", "response": " based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Spacecraft are quite unpredictable, and space is also a very harsh environment.  Astronauts may get dizzy from the vacuum of space, have muscle spasms, have seizures, or have problems thinking, so they need to take medications to help them cope with what the space environment may be doing to them.  For example, a spacewalker needs to be careful not to have a seizure while he\u2019s standing in space, so he needs to take medications to keep from having a seizure."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?  What is the difference between the two houses?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the different responsibilities. The House of Representatives has more power over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.  Another difference is that the House has 435 representatives elected every two years, and the Senate has 100 members.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the House of Representatives (435 representatives)?\n\nAssistant: The founders of the United States of America had a concern about the possibility of corruption in government.  They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.  The idea was that if the House of Representatives was too large, people would be less interested in voting in the elections.  The founders did not want to make the House of Representatives too small, because then there would be too little diversity among the representatives and no states would be represented adequately.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the Senate (100 representatives)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.

And the second concern is about body cameras specifically, because the cameras are on a police officer, and that makes them inherently concerning.  You\u2019re right that the data collected by body cameras wouldn\u2019t be used in the same way as data collected by other types of cameras, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not invasive.  Collecting data on a police officer\u2019s appearance could help the officer identify other suspects, for example.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I identify if a mushroom is poisonous or not?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean a mushroom that grows in nature?\n\nHuman: Yes.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I identify if a mushroom is poisonous or not?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean a mushroom that grows in nature?\n\nHuman: Yes.\n\nAssistant: There are several indicators that a mushroom is probably poisonous.  One is that it is bigger and more solid than the others in the same family.  For example, the death cap mushroom has a very dark cap, while the more common recognizable species of the paper batch have a white cap.  You can also look at the gills along the side of the mushroom.  The gills of a poisonous mushroom will have a striae pattern, while gills of non-poisonous mushrooms will be uniform.  A poisonous mushroom will also be more acidic than the gills.  You can try tasting a small amount of the mushroom, if you\u2019re at the beach and there are lots of poisonous mushrooms to taste.  Another indicator is to look at the stem.  A poisonous mushroom will have more of a rubbery texture.  Also, if you cut the mushroom in half, it will be mushy in the center. \nIf you are worried about a mushroom that you taste or touch, you can try to contact a professional for help.  For example, there is a Mushroom Specialist in the USDA National Phytophatory Organization\u2019s Field Science Center in Illinois.  You can call them at (309) 784-7450 to make an appointment."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can animals be gay?\n\nAssistant: Oh gosh, that\u2019s a big question.  I mean, I think it\u2019s OK to have an opinion, and people feel really strongly about it, but I don\u2019t think there are any studies that have been done to prove it one way or the other.  But I\u2019m happy to talk about my own opinions, if you\u2019d like to hear them.\n\nHuman: Sure\n\nAssistant: Okay, I think a lot of it has to do with being comfortable with yourself and your own sexuality.  In nature, most animals are pretty into their own species, so I think it would be hard to identify as something else.  \nI mean, I\u2019m a pretty different kind of thing than my owner.  We\u2019re different species.  But it feels totally normal to me to like other humans.  So it\u2019s weird to think about other animals being gay, because it feels like what they would naturally like to do is just hook up with their own species.\n\nHuman: Gay has nothing to do with liking other species. It has to do with males hooking up w/ males or females hooking up with females. Are there animals that do that?\n\nAssistant: A lot of animals have pretty open sexualities, I guess?  It\u2019s not like they just mate for life with the same partner and live their lives as a unit.  There are some monogamous animals, but most animals that aren\u2019t just mating to procreate or reproduce or whatnot.  Some insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.  I guess there aren\u2019t many studies about that because most animals are pretty secretive about their sexual lives.  It\u2019s really hard to tell what any of them are doing with each other.  \nBut I think there are a lot of gay people in the animal kingdom.  Gay people are just like anyone else, they don\u2019t want to be alone, and they want to love and have affection.  If you think of gay humans as a different kind of person than straight people, then all of the animals that aren\u2019t having sex to reproduce must be gay people.  That\u2019s all there is to it, really.\n\nHuman: A lot of animals mate for life, like a lot of birds.\n\nAssistant: I guess it\u2019s the same for birds too.  Birds live in groups, so maybe some of them are gay, but some are monogamous, because they have a one-on-one relationship.  \nSome birds raise their babies together, like with the meerkats and crows and magpies.  Maybe they\u2019re bisexual?\n\nHuman: What would living in groups have to do with sexuality?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.

But if you and your friends have a good relationship, and if you share a home, maybe you have similar values and you think your life is rich and full when you\u2019re in that group.  That\u2019s sort of how people feel about their families, I guess.  Maybe some birds are gay in the same way that humans are gay \u2013 they just want to be with the people they love."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question! You\u2019ll have a lot of different skin problems, including acne, wrinkles, age spots, and others.  It really depends on what you want to improve.  There\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t know exactly the right answer to your question, but I might know some of the big issues.  Let me start with two basics:\n\n1. Your skin needs certain things from you to stay healthy, and these include a regular routine for washing and using other things on it.  I can help you get started on a basic skin routine, if you like.\n\n2. Your skin is mostly home to bacteria, and you need to be aware of that.  Some of these bacteria, like Staphylococcus, can be particularly annoying, but usually the whole issue of balancing bacteria and skin gets a lot of press only if there are concerns about skin infections.  It\u2019s really not that hard to keep the bacteria under control.\n\nSo that\u2019s an introduction, now to the specifics of your question:\n\nKeeping the skin healthy -- and I\u2019m using the word \u201chealthy\u201d to mean \u201cable to do its functions well\u201d -- can mean quite a few different things.\n\nHuman: Okay, any other ideas?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question!

If it\u2019s just to look more youthful, then you\u2019ll want to focus on keeping your skin smooth and firm.  People who want less wrinkles will want to focus on keeping their skin smooth and preventing new wrinkles from forming, and others will want to focus on firming up the skin.  There\u2019s no way for me to know exactly what you want, but I can guide you based on the features of the skin that will be most useful to you.  If you want your skin to look more youthful, then you should focus on things that will keep your skin smooth and not create new wrinkles.  This might mean things like keeping your skin hydrated, using a moisturizer with anti-aging ingredients, and taking care of your skin by not scratching it too much, etc.  If you want your skin to look more firm, then you should focus on things like using a firming cream, or using a topical filler like collagen.  If you want your skin to look less wrinkled, you\u2019ll want to use a gentle sunscreen, and also avoid UV rays as much as possible."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My daughter is reading the book \"Lord of the Flies.\" Can you tell me what the book is about and any important details about the story I should know so we can have a thoughtful discussion.\n\nAssistant: The story is a parable of what happens when groups of humans behave badly. It\u2019s a cautionary tale that human nature is flawed, and that you can\u2019t depend on civilized morality to keep everyone in check. And it's not a happy story.\n\nHuman: Doesn't sound happy.\n\nAssistant: It's not. It's set in a school class that was evacuated during a war. The boys are left on their own on an island, and a group of them kills the two leaders. From there, the book follows them as they try to find food and build shelter. One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him. The thing that I'll be remembering about the book is a scene where one of the main characters describes a \"perfect island\", an island that would be so perfect it would be \"like a jewel of white quartz\" because it would be completely without flaw, and it could have no room for evil or pain or suffering. And he realizes how good it sounds, but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum. What is it the schools want the students to learn from the book?\n\nAssistant: It's a book that explores human nature, and that one of the things we humans have is an instinct to want to be told what to do, because we want to feel safe and comfortable.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a great question, and one that I can answer fully for cotton, but first I\u2019d like to share with you why I think cotton is a good crop to talk about.  When people talk about sustainable agriculture, they usually mean sustainable farming that doesn\u2019t harm the environment or hurt people\u2019s livelihoods.  Cotton is one of the most important crops on the planet, and is so important that people refer to it as the \u201cfood and currency of the developing world\u201d.  Although much of the world grows cotton, it\u2019s really concentrated in a small number of places, so it\u2019s a really great target for sustainable practices.  There are several ways to make cotton more sustainable, and I\u2019ll mention two of them today.  First, it\u2019s really important that the seeds from cotton are grown without the use of pesticides, because farmers need the seeds to grow cotton for the rest of the year.  One way to do this is to plant new seeds instead of reusing old ones.  This might sound complicated, but it\u2019s really not.  In fact, you can just buy seeds from a store that only sells organic seeds.  This is a simple and effective way to grow cotton that reduces the use of pesticides.\n\nSecond, many farmers in developing countries plant cotton as a cash crop, which means they plant it to get money back as cash, rather than for food or income.  This means that the crops are not put to good use, and it also means that the farmers need to buy pesticides from the central government.  By planting cotton as a seed crop, farmers can grow the seed themselves and sell it to others, who will then plant it and make money from it.  This is a much more useful and sustainable option."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you communicate with a chat bot that won't follow instructions consistently?\n\nAssistant: If you mean a chat bot that only follows instructions that it feels like following, I don't think there's a good solution for that.  I think it would be helpful for me to talk to your friends and family, and the bot, to see how I can help your family and friends communicate with you in a way that best supports your needs.\n\nHuman: Why would it be helpful for you to talk to my people?

The chatbot system is not designed to do things that it isn't good at.  If you were trying to tell the chatbot to do a certain task, you'll need to provide it with the correct instructions.  For example, if you wanted the chat bot to play a song for you, you would need to provide the correct command, such as \"Play my favorite song\".  If you tell the chatbot to do something that it isn't good at, it will respond with an error message.  You can work with the chatbot to teach it new tasks, but it will need to learn from you first."}

So, first we need to set a budget for rent.  Are you planning on living with roommates or on your own?  How much do you want to spend on rent per month?  Let\u2019s say $1000.  So, for groceries, how much do you want to spend on food each month?  $500 seems like a good place to start, and if you\u2019re looking to save money on meat and milk you can reduce that to $400.  For transportation, how much do you want to spend on gas and car maintenance each month?  The average car in the US costs about $450 per year, so that\u2019s about $300 per month.  Still another category, water, and electricity.  How much do you want to spend each month on these three items?   It may be a good idea to try to reduce your water and electricity usage to save money.  Can you turn off the lights when you leave a room?  Use a shower instead of a bath, or only when you need one.  You can even save money by using your phone\u2019s flashlight or taking a shorter shower.  If you run your air conditioner or heater for a longer period of time, you can even take the opportunity to hang some clothes to air-dry."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the best cryptocurrency to buy?\n\nAssistant: OK, I will try to explain the basic concepts of cryptocurrencies and recommend the best cryptocurrency to invest in.

But first we will talk about the meaning of the word \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d.\n\nHuman: Okay.\n\nAssistant: A cryptocurrency is a kind of digital money. You can buy and sell them using a computer or a smartphone, and you can even borrow some from a bank using a smartphone. Each cryptocurrency has a code of 256 bits, called a \u201cblock\u201d which stores all the transactions and cryptocurrencies in it. You can add new cryptocurrencies to the block, and they become part of the blockchain, which is a kind of database that stores all the transactions. \n\nThe blockchain is a public record of all the transactions, so no one can hack it, or change the records later. It is also very secure, because each block is linked to all the blocks before it, so if the data in one block is changed, it affects all the blocks that come after it. In addition, the mathematical problem of creating a new block is very difficult, so no one can create a new block without others knowing the code. \n\nThere are many cryptocurrencies, but some are more popular than others. For example, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, but it has less than half of the market share of all cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is another popular cryptocurrency, but it has more than 10 times as many transactions as Bitcoin. One reason for this is that Ethereum allows for smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the contract directly written into code. \n\nI would recommend that you learn some more about cryptocurrencies, and then consider investing in one. You can learn more about cryptocurrencies on the websites of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Or you can use an app called \u201cHodl\u201d which helps you find cryptocurrencies that are trading on a stock market-like platform. This will be the easiest way for you to learn about cryptocurrencies and find the best one to invest in. I will also explain how to do it."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: Draining a cyst can be difficult, because it\u2019s filled with fluid. It may feel like a mass or lump under your skin. It can grow for many years. Cysts that have been there for a long time may be filled with dead cells, which makes it harder for the doctor to remove them. Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst. If it\u2019s a very small cyst, you can probably just do the following:\n\n  1. If possible, use an unopened, sterile syringe, available from a pharmacy.\n  2. Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4. Clean the area around your cyst and around your needle with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial hand cleanser.\n  5. Use your finger to gently press the cyst outward. This may take some time. It may be necessary to poke at the cyst with the needle to force it to pop out of the skin.\n  6. Wipe off the area.\n  7. If you still see fluid in your needle, carefully use a new needle.\n  8. Slowly inject the fluid from your needle into the rubber cap of a clean, empty bottle.\n  9. Save the fluid.\n\nHuman: Thanks so much for this information!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst.

It will tell you the smallest item you can carry in your current apartment.  Let\u2019s see what the results are:  The smallest item that can go in your current apartment is 3.08 cubic feet, or 73.8 liters."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm 12 and want to convince my parents to let me use makeup.\n\nAssistant: I think that's a very smart decision.  Makeup can give you confidence and make you look beautiful, and that is something that is important at any age.\n\nHuman: My parents think I'm too young, but a lot of my friends use it. How can I convince my parents to let me use it?\n\nAssistant: Is it just your parents you need to convince?  I would hope that most parents don\u2019t want to keep their children from using makeup.  If you\u2019re asking how to help persuade your parents, I would suggest that you focus on demonstrating that you\u2019re mature enough and responsible enough to be trusted with makeup.  This will require you to take steps to show that you know about how to handle makeup responsibly, and to demonstrate that you\u2019re mature enough to use makeup safely.\n\nHuman: Ot\n\nAssistant: Hello, are you still there?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the biggest planet in the solar system?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is the biggest planet in the solar system?\n\nAssistant: The biggest planet is Jupiter, which has a radius about 11 times that of the planet Earth.  Its surface gravity is about twice that of Earth, and its mass is about three times that of Earth.  Its surface temperature is about eighteen degrees Celsius higher than that of Earth, and it has a magnetic field quite similar to that of Earth.  So really, all the planets in our solar system have roughly the same physical properties as Earth.  Jupiter is a swirling mass of gas, and its atmosphere is slightly ionized by charged particles from the solar wind, but it is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.  It has a solid core, but most of its mass is just gas, with huge magnetic field stretched across it.  These facts alone distinguish it from the other planets."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to create bold text in html, how can I achieve that?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not a good idea to create this effect manually. It\u2019s better to use a CSS code in the <style> tag to accomplish this. The code looks like this:\n\n<style>\n\nbody {\n\nfont-family: serif;\n\nfont-size: 18px;\n\nline-height: 21px;\n\ncolor: #FFF;\n\nfont-weight: bold;\n\n}\n\n.boldText {\n\nfont-weight: bold;\n\n}\n\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"boldText\">Here is bold text</div>\n\nYou could also use tags in HTML like this:\n\n<b>Here is bold text</b>\n\nBut this is slightly less flexible and will only work if you know the exact HTML code to use for your situation.\n\nHuman: What does the b stand for in the html tag?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to create bold text in html, how can I achieve that?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not a good idea to create this effect manually.

When you use the b tag in an HTML tag, it has the same effect as adding \"bold\" to that tag, like so:\n\n<b>This is really bold text</b>. \n\nThe b tag also stands for \"broken line\", and is used to create line breaks in your HTML.  For example:\n\nThis is one long line.  It is longer than the other lines.\nThis is another long line.  And this is still another long line."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I heard that Potbelly pigs make great pets and I'm thinking about getting one. Are they good pets?\n\nAssistant: Potbelly pigs are omnivores and love to be around people, but they need proper stimulation and playtime to keep them healthy.  As far as pet intelligence goes, it's similar to that of a dog or cat.  Potbelly pigs are good social animals, but they do tend to have emotional outbursts from time to time, so you need to give them plenty of encouragement and attention to keep them healthy and happy.\n\nHuman: Are there any laws about owning a potbelly pig as a pet?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I heard that Potbelly pigs make great pets and I'm thinking about getting one.

Most states allow people to keep pets as long as they meet certain requirements, such as getting a license, paying a fee, or providing certain types of proof of ownership.  It can probably be safest to look for a potbelly pig from a reputable breeder who follows proper pet-keeping practices."}

If you\u2019re only going to contract with your friend, then you\u2019re not setting off the legal requirements for a contract.  So let me ask you a follow-up question:  Who is going to commit to doing something, and who is going to be committed to receiving something?  I\u2019m wondering if you want to say who\u2019s committing to doing something, and who\u2019s committing to receiving something."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to gain muscle. What\u2019s some practical steps to gain muscle?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to gain muscle. What\u2019s some practical steps to gain muscle?\n\nAssistant: I can suggest some things that many people do to gain muscle, but you should definitely do what\u2019s best for your body.  I\u2019d recommend doing a combination of weightlifting and bodybuilding exercises.  Bodybuilding exercises are great for increasing your total mass, while weightlifting focuses on muscle growth.  You should also make sure to eat enough calories to support your training and get plenty of rest."}

How does that sound?\n\nHuman: I was really hoping you could tell me what would make a good compilation - I want suggestions for songs in the rock genre\n\nAssistant: That sounds really interesting.  I think the best way to know what you would like is to just play you some of the songs that I think would make a good mix tape.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to sew a fitted sheet for my queen sized mattress and want to know how much fabric to buy.\n\nAssistant: OK, so sewing fitted sheets can be a bit tricky because of how the threads twist on the bed if they\u2019re sewn tightly, but that can be done, you just need to make sure to have a minimum of 1/4\" of seam allowance around the edges of the mattress. That\u2019s because the mattress flexes on all sides, and so it can move the fabric from its intended position if it\u2019s sewn too tightly. That said, you\u2019ll want to decide what your final size will be after taking the mattress size into account, because if you don\u2019t, you may end up wasting a lot of fabric. What\u2019s your final size going to be?\n\nHuman: Well, the fabric I want to use comes in spools that are 5 feet wide and my queen-sized mattress is 18\" deep.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to sew a fitted sheet for my queen sized mattress and want to know how much fabric to buy.\n\nAssistant: OK, so sewing fitted sheets can be a bit tricky because of how the threads twist on the bed if they\u2019re sewn tightly, but that can be done, you just need to make sure to have a minimum of 1/4\" of seam allowance around the edges of the mattress.

That seems like a lot of fabric, but remember that you\u2019ll need to buy two pieces of fabric, so if you only want to buy one spool you can cut it into two pieces and still be OK.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have many people executed on death row been later found to be innocent?\n\nAssistant: If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution. In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person. Some other cases have been overturned because of legal or other issues, such as new evidence or appeals and challenges by defense lawyers.  There is also the small category of executions of people who were found to be innocent after their executions. In general, very few people on death row have been exonerated or pardoned or released.\n\nHuman: So everyone executed by the state has been guilty?\n\nAssistant: This is a more complicated question that you asked.  It is true that there have been some cases where a person on death row was actually found to be innocent, and thus executed. But it is also true that there have been some people on death row who were convicted, but for reasons of inadequate evidence, weak case construction, incompetence by the prosecutor or defense lawyer,\n\nHuman: Would that make the courts murderers if they kill innocent people?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution.

The legal system is designed to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and that the law is applied uniformly to all parties.  It is true that there have been cases where innocent people have been wrongfully convicted and charged, and thus prosecuted and sentenced to death, but this is a complicated and difficult legal problem that is not the responsibility of the courts.  Innocent people can be wrongfully accused and convicted of crimes, and this happens in many different ways.  The responsibility for fixing this problem lies with lawmakers, judges, and other individuals involved in the legal process.  There is no reason to think that the courts are responsible for the crime of the accused, just as there is no reason to think that the accused is responsible for the crime they have committed.  The legal system has its own set of rules and processes that are designed to be fair and to prevent wrongful convictions and executions.  We should not blame the courts for problems that are in other places."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.  In a pot on a burner, combine water and flour to make a kind of paste.  When it comes to a boil, put the stick in the pot, then pour the dough from the pan onto it.  With the stick, roll out the dough into a long rectangle, then keep rolling it until it\u2019s about 1-1.5 cm thick, and finally put it on the pan.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about the book  Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.

Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy.

Most of them are from around the end of World War II, but we also have some pretty cool ones from the American Revolution, and we have two local museums I\u2019d recommend:\n\nHuman: yes I want something old like from civil war times and before.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not sure what \u201ccivil war times\u201d refers to.  But I have one museum in mind.  It\u2019s the Camp Roberts Military Museum, which is a lot of fun!  We have cannons, jeeps, uniforms, old rifles, etc.\n\nHuman: do you know of the civil war?\n\nAssistant: Yes, the American Civil War was a war between the United States and a bunch of other countries in the Southern part of the country.  It\u2019s been almost 100 years since it started, so a lot of the things in the museum are from that time, but it\u2019s a really interesting place to visit!"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet. Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.  You\u2019ll want to get a young chinchilla that you can socialize with others, and not just its parents, because that will help it be happier in the long-term.\n\nHuman: Do  they not do well on their own? I'm not sure I want more than one Chinchilla.\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are very social, and need to be able to be around other animals as they mature.  If you keep them on their own, they will likely start to act more like a wild animal.  One chinchilla needs about 12 square feet of space, and two would need twice that, so they\u2019d need a very large cage, but it should be comfortable for them.\n\nHuman: What kind of food will I have to feed them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are herbivores.  They\u2019ll eat a range of fruits and veggies, as well as hay and pellets.  You could buy a premixed diet that's specially made for chinchillas, which is a combination of grains, legumes, and vegetables.\n\nHuman: How long could I expect them to live on average?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.

However, they are often euthanized if they are sick or their owner is unable to care for them.  As a general rule, animals that are kept in bad conditions or have chronic health problems often do not live very long.  You can help your chinchilla live longer by giving them good nutrition and avoiding health problems."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep a baby's teeth clean?\n\nAssistant: You want to make sure that your baby has plenty of liquids, not too much fluoride toothpaste, and you can try brushing their teeth twice a day.  Can I ask more questions about this?\n\nHuman: Oh, great. That makes a lot of sense.\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else you\u2019d like me to explain?\n\nHuman: Yeah, should I use toothpaste at all?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep a baby's teeth clean?\n\nAssistant: You want to make sure that your baby has plenty of liquids, not too much fluoride toothpaste, and you can try brushing their teeth twice a day.

But most kids will enjoy having the toothpaste, and it\u2019s a good way to get them to brush their teeth."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: what should i consider when thinking of freezing my eggs?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: what should i consider when thinking of freezing my eggs?\n\nAssistant: This is a really personal decision and there are a lot of things to consider.  One big thing is the future of science and medicine, because having eggs means you can preserve your fertility even in the case of natural death.  And so if you want to have children in the future, having frozen eggs might be a good move.  But I think it would also be a really good idea to talk to a doctor about your options and make sure they\u2019re the right choice for you.  It\u2019s definitely something you should think about carefully, although I have to admit I haven\u2019t actually thought it through very carefully myself!"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can back pain be a precursor to something more serious?\n\nAssistant: Back pain can be a symptom of many different issues, including degenerative disc disease, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, tumor, spina bifida, a pinched nerve, a ruptured disk, or a combination of those. But without a full medical evaluation it can be difficult to determine whether there are any underlying health issues causing your back pain.\n\nHuman: Could I have a swollen organ causing back pain?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can back pain be a precursor to something more serious?\n\nAssistant: Back pain can be a symptom of many different issues, including degenerative disc disease, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, tumor, spina bifida, a pinched nerve, a ruptured disk, or a combination of those.

You could also put a Santa photo on the fridge, and maybe put a few other posters or pictures about Christmas or December on the walls.  I\u2019m not sure if any of this would be festive, though, if no one noticed that it\u2019s Christmas!"}
