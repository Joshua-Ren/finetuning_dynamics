He saw that \u201chumans live together\u201d in the quote above, and by creating laws and government and government officials to enforce laws and agreements, society\u2019s members will, in effect, create this binding contract to protect and provide for each other.

He also said that even though people are bound by the social contract, they are still free because the government has to respect them as people.  That said, the fact that a government can enforce laws pretty much means that the government has power, and government leaders have more power than others, so it\u2019s not really possible for everyone to be equal.

In addition to the fact that it is a network, it is important to understand that it is a global network.

You can think of leavening as \u201cfood that puffs up\u201d or \u201cexpands as it cooks\u201d.

To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.

I think \"rotation around its own axis\" is probably better phrased for a literal definition to avoid ambiguity.\nIf this is the case however, you probably already know what rotation is, right? It's simply the rotation of something around a point that it moves around relative to itself. For example, the rotation of a wheel on a car. The car is moving relative to itself (the wheels), and the wheel is rotating without moving (relative to the ground).\nThe fact that the wheel isn't moving with respect to the ground suggests that something else is pulling it around. And it turns out that there is some friction that is acting on the wheel, called static friction. Its name comes from the idea that if the wheel is going to stop without sliding against the friction, there should be a greater force acting to get it to stop, as well as friction against the force that is actually keeping it moving."}

However, many American actresses have played supporting roles in Batman media, such as Cat Woman in the original series or Lois Lang in the Nolan films. I don't know of any supporting females to the main title either, but I do recognize that there are female characters present in the universe.\nThe same answer applies: @Hippocampus's sentence is wrong: \nthe word \"supporting\" implies that Batman is some sort of side character, and that is not the case, he's the main character.  In fact, the Nolan films include no dialogue that would suggest this is the case.\nHe's not just any side character either: @KipKessler's answer is wrong: A supporting role in a television series has nothing to do with a character in a comic book, they're just actors whose jobs it is to fill in gaps when needed.  They are no more or less equal to the roles they play on TV than they are on Batman comics.  \n\n"}

Wire cages don\u2019t provide them with the high-space area they prefer, so you can use the floor and walls to keep them interested.  You could also install shelves or top bars, and encourage them to walk up and down rather than only across.\n\nSolid enclosures are less interesting to them, but they'll be less active in a solid enclosure, which means they'll use it less, and they can't break it up and use it to climb out.  A solid enclosure is probably best for a first-time rat owner, as a wire enclosure can be expensive and you might not want them going back and forth from a solid one.\n\nAs far as food goes, you can feed them a wide variety of foods, ranging from just plain wheat, to rabbit or hamster kibble, to sunflower seeds, and pretty much anything you might want to eat.  Rats are omnivores like us, so you'll want to feed them a diet of healthy fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and vegetables.  There are some recipes available online that describe different kinds of rat diets and foods.  You can also buy pre-made rat food.\n\nWhat I think you're asking about is the area they'll use for their bathroom and when they need to get out.  This depends on the type of cage and type of animal.  Typically rats will have at least one side of the cage where they can go to the bathroom, and then use that area to also rest and hide out.  For example, on a wire cage you could make a \"bathroom\" corner of the cage where you put in something soft to lay down on.  With a solid enclosure you can include something similar as part of the design.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "response": " from a solid one.\n\nAs far as food goes, you can feed them a wide variety of foods, ranging from just plain wheat, to rabbit or hamster kibble, to sunflower seeds, and pretty much anything you might want to eat.

It\u2019s generally a good idea to use active voice and rephrase the sentences so that you are not speaking about the situation and what\u2019s going on. For example, the first sentence should really be \u201cOf course, I\u2019m happy to help\u201d. You could also say that it\u2019s because I\u2019ve given you an opportunity to do so. \nSecondly, it\u2019s important to rephrase sentences in this way to express or emphasize your meaning. Remember that not all words in English need to be used. For example, you could rephrase the first sentence, \u201cI\u2019m happy to help\u201d, using \u201cI\u2019m happy"}
