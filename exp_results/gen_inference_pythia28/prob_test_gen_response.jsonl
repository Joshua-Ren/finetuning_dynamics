The fruit itself is used to make jelly, and sometimes there's a sliver stuck in the top as decoration, but it will taste very different.  And, a pumpkin isn't a squash, it's a fruit.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is it important to get plenty of vitamins in your diet, and how best to go about this?\n\nAssistant: I think most people need a lot of vitamins, but that usually comes from eating food rather than from supplements.  What sort of vitamins are you looking to get?  Vitamin A, C, E, D, and B vitamins are especially important.  What foods do you eat?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd like to make sure that I'm getting enough of the essential vitamins from the food that I buy. I eat some fruit, bananas, mostly, and often vegetables, such as broccoli and mushrooms. What else do I need?\n\nAssistant: If you like fresh vegetables, there are lots of different kinds to choose from.  What about green, leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and chard?  You can also eat lots of colored vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Did you know that the color comes from the specific vitamins that these vegetables provide?  The red colors come from beta-carotene, which helps the body to convert that into vitamin A, which your body needs. \nThis is just one example of the importance of eating the whole vegetable, including all of its colors.  In general, it\u2019s important to get lots of different kinds of colorful vegetables in your diet.  And you can also add beans and nuts to your diet.\n\nHuman: Great. So a good balance of colours is important?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s really important to get the right vitamins and minerals that are from the foods you eat, rather than just from supplements, which can be less healthy.  And you want to eat a variety of different kinds of colorful vegetables.\n\nHuman: Okay thanks. Are there particular vitamins in foods that help the skin and hair?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are two particular vitamins that are related to the health of the skin and hair.  Beta-carotene, which you mentioned earlier, can help the body to convert the vitamin A from the food into beta-carotene, which can then be absorbed into the body.  And this vitamin A can help you to maintain good skin and hair.  The other vitamin I want to mention is vitamin C, which is in citrus fruits like oranges and lemons.  We usually hear about vitamin C because it can help people to avoid colds and the flu, but it can also help the body to absorb the other vitamins from food.  And so a healthy diet would be full of foods that have a variety of vitamins and minerals in them.\n\nHuman: What about the eyes, is there a good vitamin or diet to promote healthy eyes?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "istant: It\u2019s really important to get the right vitamins and minerals that are from the foods you eat, rather than just from supplements, which can be less healthy.

What you see on the skin is a result of the sun burning your skin, which can cause a bunch of different types of skin damage.  One way that you can protect your skin from that is by eating foods that have a high amount of beta-carotene in them.  If your skin is getting a lot of direct sun rays, then eating foods with beta-carotene can help protect the skin.  Another option is to take extra vitamin A into your body through either the diet or supplement.  The type of vitamin A that your body converts to beta-carotene is from certain"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!  Historians agree that American governance traces back to British ideas about a separation of powers and mixed monarchy.  The US Constitution draws a lot from the English.\n\nHuman: So France didn't have much influence?\n\nAssistant: That is correct.  France's best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.

And a different number of turrets, etc.\n\nHuman: How fast could the Montana class go?\n\nAssistant: Around 14,000 (13 knots) in moderate sea state.\n\nHuman: How fast did the Montana class do at full power?\n\nAssistant: Between 18,000 to 20,000 miles an hour.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between an Aircraft Carrier and Battleship?\n\nAssistant: A carrier is a faster vessel but is not as deep or well positioned to handle the same mission as a battleship.\n\nHuman: Why have USS Iowa, and not other battleships like the USS Arizona?\n\nAssistant: Because of the famous battle of the I-was-going-to-retire-to-farming-Iowa incident.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Would you be able to explain the differences between the Spanish and Italian language?\n\nAssistant: Of course.  Can you tell me more about the specific areas where you\u2019re interested in knowing more?\n\nHuman: I'm thinking between the Spanish spoken in Mexico and Italian spoken in Italy.\n\nAssistant: Okay, great.  Well both Spanish and Italian come from the same language group, but they differ in many ways.  Spanish has a more rich vocabulary, whereas Italian has been described as \u201cless rich\u201d and \u201cmore concise.\u201d  For example, \u201canoche\u201d is a commonly used word in Spanish that means \u201clast night,\u201d whereas in Italian, \u201cieri\u201d is the word for that.  Of course, this is just one small example, so I could go into more detail about how these languages are different.\n\nHuman: Okay, please go into more detail about how they're different\n\nAssistant: Well, the syntax is similar, as both languages are members of the romance language group.  But there are a few other key differences.  For example, Italian has fewer word forms for the past tense, so it can be hard for people from Spanish-speaking countries to pick up Italian.\n\nHuman: Hm, okay. What else?\n\nAssistant: As far as vocabulary, I\u2019ve already mentioned one example.  Italian can be considered a more concise language, as the total word count is around half of that in Spanish.  And, Italian is considered to be \u201cmore rational\u201d, and thus less poetic, than Spanish.  Other differences include the greater number of Italian dialects, the historical-evolution aspect of Italian, the lack of a gender-neutral pronoun, and the Italian-language impact in the world.\n\nHuman: Got it!

But you don't know very much about the club, so you don't know whether you need to join it or not. Here's the trick: if you have a small-scale organization (e.g. a small town and its surrounding community) you'll often hear people say, \"It's a stitch in time saves nine.\" \"It\" refers to the organization that has a small but critical problem that you want your solution to resolve. Thus, by saying \"a stitch in time\" you are really saying, \"don't let your organization get into a major problem by committing to"}

It\u2019s actually about the history of capitalism.\n\nHuman: Who were the designers of the board game?\n\nAssistant: The designers were an American family. They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.  She worked on playing the game, and wrote down her observations in a little notebook. Charles used the information from her notebook to make adjustments to the game.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who is considered the best golf player of all time and why?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question because there are many dimensions to consider when evaluating a golf player. For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does \u201cbest\u201d refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others.\n\nHuman: Okay, interesting. I know he was really good for a few years but then went into a slump. Did you take that into account?\n\nAssistant: This is true, but the human ability to distinguish \u201cdown periods\u201d from \u201cslumps\u201d is surprisingly accurate. While our perceptions of when an athlete is performing well may not be perfectly accurate, in general our perception of the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d can be fairly good, as compared to other historical sports. For example, in the NBA, players like Lebron James and Michael Jordan are both recognized as the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d, despite Lebron\u2019s time in Miami (and his continued success in Cleveland) being viewed as a \u201cslump\u201d. If anything, we tend to undervalue Lebron because his best teams weren\u2019t all from Cleveland.\n\nHuman: Okay, I guess that makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: You can buy property through a real estate agent or a realtor. There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash. In the U.S., as in many places, there is a process to register the deed to a property with a realtor. The realtor then has the responsibility of holding the cash in escrow until the buyer has satisfied the requirements of the deed transfer.\n\nHuman: I see. That makes sense. I assume the realtor of course would get something from helping both parties. How much do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price. In some states they are not allowed to charge any fee. The realtor can also be paid with a commission, and in that case the realtor may get a commission of 5% to 10% of the selling price.  There are also taxes, transaction fees, and closing costs.\n\nHuman: Does the buyer pay for those costs, or the seller?\n\nAssistant: Both parties pay for some of those.  For example, a buyer and seller both pay transaction fees for property transfers. But some fees can only be paid by one party, or only by the buyer.  The realtor will be able to explain in more detail.\n\nHuman: Thank you again. If say either the buyer or the seller wants to cancel the transaction, will there still be fees involved?\n\nAssistant: The seller may get some back if the sale doesn\u2019t close, but the buyer will have to pay a fee to the realtor in the form of a transaction fee if the sale falls through.\n\nHuman: I really appreciate your help.

He believed in what was known in his time, that is, in the Aristotelian natural philosophy. However, his writings reflect the evolution of Western philosophy, which took place with the rise of the new science, reason.

What else is there for the algae to grow on?\n\nAssistant: For one, the warmer the water, the more algae has to grow.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Are there any vegetables that I can plant in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Sure, you can plant carrots and turnips in the fall.  Some people also like to plant beets, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for beginners.  Are you planting indoors or outside?\n\nHuman: I would be planting them outside in my backyard.\n\nAssistant: Well, outside is a better option, because with most of your plants, you\u2019ll get a better yield, and the harvest will be ready sooner.  So if you\u2019re planting indoors you might just plant seeds.  If you\u2019re planting outside, you can plant transplants, which is the fastest way to get a plant up and growing.\n\nHuman: Would they be able to survive through the winter months?\n\nAssistant: Not normally, although there are varieties that are known to survive cold temperatures.  If you\u2019re growing the vegetables outdoors you might also plant them in containers.  There are different vegetables that you can plant in pots and then they can be brought inside for the winter, so you can still get a lot of use out of them.\n\nHuman: How much space would I need to dedicate if I wanted to grow the carrots in the fall?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " fall?\n\nAssistant: Sure, you can plant carrots and turnips in the fall.

That depends on the variety of the carrots you\u2019re growing.  If you\u2019re using the red kind, you\u2019re gonna need more space to be able to pick the carrots.

It was originally called the \u201cNew Tower\u201d. As with many other European cities, Pisa became a significant center of commerce in Europe, and the tower was designed to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350. The tower was built during two phases: an initial phase, and then a phase of additions. The first phase was designed and constructed between 1173 and 1177. It was originally 120m tall, with two floors of polygonal masonry. Between 1220 and 1224 a new floor of marble was added, bringing the height to 140m.

But I can share that mental health is very important, and how they are feeling may impact the decisions they are making. Depression and anxiety can get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter. You can also ask if they are happy with their care, and ask if they would like to see a therapist or talk to a nurse, doctor or social worker. If you are concerned about mental health, you can also ask them how they are feeling and if they\u2019d like to talk about their problems. They may also need to use these tools, and feel like they are a burden to others. But most people love to talk about themselves, so try asking how they are doing. It\u2019s really important to remember that you can\u2019t force someone to get help, though. So maybe it will be good to ask them if they would like to talk to a therapist, and if they are okay with that, then you can call the therapist on their behalf.

Those metals have a property called \u201cresonance\u201d, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.

But to simplify, most Buddhist temples, and many temples in general, are places where people can practice their chosen way of life, such as vegetarianism, or drinking green tea. You may even have a vegetarian cooking class while in a Buddhist temple.\n\nHuman: We\u2019ve never heard of temples to worship Buddha for Christians or Jews.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.  In order to do this, we can do many different things, but I\u2019ll highlight a few key tips.\n\nHuman: Okay, go on\n\nAssistant: First of all, since cats are usually more wary and skittish, we can help them feel safer by removing their fear of unfamiliar dogs through the process of desensitization and counter-conditioning.  For example, it\u2019s often helpful to take a kitten to a dog day care center, where the kittens and dogs are in an enclosed area, and dogs are closely monitored to prevent any harm.  This process can make the kitten less fearful of dogs.\n\nHuman: Okay, that seems like a helpful tip\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.

For example, you could approach it as you would any other animal and play quietly with it.\n\nHuman: That sounds helpful\n\nAssistant: Once your kitten has learned to feel comfortable with dogs in the room, you can gradually introduce it one at a time for a few days, beginning with a puppy or young dog.\n\nHuman: That sounds helpful\n\nAssistant: You can also approach the dog in a different way, like introducing yourself and playing with them as if it\u2019s a very familiar thing.

This can really drain power, and depending on your computer and your phone, you should turn off WiFi at night to conserve energy.

For me I have to go with U2\u2019s 1985 album, Achtung Baby. It has everything; great songs, great music, great lyrics, great production, and yes, great album cover. That was all I was looking for.\n\nHuman: If I were giving out album rankings, I'd give it #6, because at the time that album came out, music was in decline.

This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.  For example, if you are interested in the cutting and styling of hair, then I would recommend using your personal experience and contacts to start a salon or stylist shop.

It usually takes place the day after the funeral and is most commonly associated with observant Jewish culture.\n\nHuman: Who attends the Shiva?\n\nAssistant: Some of the family of the deceased may attend the shiva, including extended family.\n\nHuman: I also hear the word shomer?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re right, shomer is the Hebrew term for \u201cescort\u201d, and means the person who accompanies the body to the funeral and who watches the body during the shiva.  There is a shomer for the body at the funeral, and a shomer for the shiva.\n\nHuman: Yes. I heard some families have a shomer sit with the deceased in the funeral home prior to the burial.\n\nAssistant: Yes, families may employ a shomer for the funeral, and they\u2019re usually also employed as a shomer in the Jewish community. As part of this, the shomer at the funeral is often referred to by the locals as the shomer shabbath, or \u201cescort during the Shabbath\u201d.\n\nHuman: I heard a funeral may be held in the Orthodox home.\n\nAssistant: The funeral may be held in the house of the deceased, in a Jewish cemetery, or in the house of the shomer. It is common for the body of the deceased to be transferred to the Jewish home, a process called kaddish, usually several days after the funeral.\n\nHuman:"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s because the moon takes seven days to fully eclipse the sun. The days vary so the sun will pass between full Moon and new Moon on each of the 7 days as well.\n\nCockroaches: Why don\u2019t they move at night?\n\nAssistant: They are mostly nocturnal. Most live active, or active by night, but in a colony you may see \u201cdormant\u201d which means they live at least 15 minutes from the colony\u2019s peak of activity."}

Baking sheets can be in many sizes and materials, such as stoneware or silicone. In many recipes the baking sheets will only be used to bake something on, so they don\u2019t need to be fancy, but you\u2019ll want them to fit your oven.  Pans will also be used to bake things, and they are mostly used in standard sizes. A pie tin is a good example of a pan for baking.\n\nTo make a pie or cake, you\u2019ll need a sharp knife.

For instance, the more severe the injury, the more severe the impact of a force, the more severe that injury on the brain - whether there's a skull fracture or brain swelling, etc. Is it causing brain damage? Can that patient have a normal life? Can they work?\n\nDoctor: For TBI, you need two factors. One is acute injuries or the immediate impact that they experienced and the other is the injury having a high likelihood of the brain sustaining damage.

I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What equipment do I need for rock climbing?\n\nAssistant: Climbing requires proper shoes, pants, a harness, and maybe a rope. What you choose to wear depends on whether you\u2019re going to the gym or if you\u2019re climbing outdoors.  It can also depend on the particular route you\u2019re planning to climb and the grade of the route.\n\nHuman: I will be climbing outdoors.\n\nAssistant: I think you should have a helmet, so that you can wear a hardhat.  You might also want a pack, which helps carry all the gear you\u2019ll need.  Another thing you might want is a pocket knife.\n\nHuman: I have all of the proper clothing. I just need the climbing gear and the safety equipment.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably a good idea to wear shoes that can grip.  They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information.

They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information. I was able to learn something from this conversation.\n\nAssistant: Any time you have questions about that equipment, you should go to your store and talk to an associate.  We just work at the store and want to give the best information possible to our customers.  The store will provide you with safety gear, gear recommendations, and a link to web-based safety information like our site and the National Outdoor Leadership School website.  Hopefully, this guide will help you choose the right gear.  Here are a couple additional safety gear tips to help you prepare for your outdoor adventure.  First, wear climbing shoes with the rubber soles and hard top soles if possible.  Second, use your feet.  If you have shoes that grip, you\u2019ll be"}

A more relevant factor might be whether you\u2019re likely to win any given game or be a good teammate and a good leader.\n\nHuman: Let's start with the most all-star games.

But before we get too deep, let's start by making sure that we\u2019re talking about career statistics (which are not going to be much different for baseball than for basketball), and by making sure that we understand that different people use different criteria for what qualifies a player for being \u201call-time best.\u201d   And as much as it might seem simple to use \u201cpoints scored in a career,\u201d there's a lot more to it.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you recommend a good inexpensive table wine to serve with turkey?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m glad you asked.  You might enjoy a Tannat, which is a grape that grows in the southwest of France.  It has a robust, tannic flavor that works well with a fatty turkey.  Plus it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive wine, and there\u2019s usually a bottle of it at the liquor store.\n\nHuman: Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s another wine you might like, a Pinot Noir.  It\u2019s a red grape that grows in the northwest of France.  The flavor is rich, full, and yet light.  It has a smooth and velvety texture.\n\nHuman: Thanks.\n\nAssistant: One more.  This one is a bit more expensive, but well worth the price, a Caladoc from the Jura region.  It is a good mix of strength and delicacy, of depth and finesse.  It\u2019s almost like comparing a beautiful woman who loves to have fun and a serious, sophisticated professional.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the recommendations.\n\nAssistant: Oh, one more.  I wanted to share my favorite wine.  It\u2019s a Muscadet from the Loire Valley in France.  It\u2019s a lighter, fresher, and more delicate wine, with a delicate floral and citrus flavor.  I often find that it complements seafood better than a heavy red or white wine.\n\nHuman: Great.

It\u2019s more about the fruits than the grapes, just like the nectar of a flower, a sip or taste of honey.  It can be light or dark, depending on the grape variety.  If you don't have one of these at home, it\u2019s okay to substitute a sweet white wine.  We have quite a few of those.\n\nHuman: Yes.

These open and close, as they are called, on their own, and then new skin cells grow in over them. This cycle perpetuates, but if you can clear these openings, the acne will disappear.\n\nHuman: Will doing anything about it hurt the skin?\n\nAssistant: Not at all. Acne will go away when you get the opening in the skin, not when you treat it.

I suggest trying to find the best tempo as you can fit the music with it. Also, have some dancers who have an interesting range in their body movements.\n\nHuman: What makes good group dancing?\n\nAssistant: Good group dancing is simply when there is no one dancing alone.

If you are experiencing constipation due to bananas then you may try eating more fiber rich food, increasing your water intake and ensuring a regular bowel movement regime.\n\nHuman: ok, what else can you tell me about bananas?\n\nAssistant: Bananas are one of the richest fruits in dietary fiber, potassium, and Vitamin B6. In fact, they are rich in dietary fiber, potassium, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C and Vitamin B12. When cooked, banana is very high in Vitamin A, which is great for the eyes. Bananas are filled with antioxidants, potassium and vitamin B6, which helps in keeping blood pressure in check and normalizes blood sugar levels. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps maintain electrolyte levels in the body. Bananas help in strengthening bones, reducing the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol levels.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I wear a mask inside even if I am vaccinated?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not the best person to answer that question, because I haven\u2019t been vaccinated and I don\u2019t have any expertise with infectious diseases.  If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.  Here are a couple of points that come up a lot, in various forms:\n\n1) It might reduce the impact of the virus, since it could reduce the amount of virus you catch.\n\n2) Masks might not be helpful if you\u2019re outdoors in a good area (like a park) because you don\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.  However, it seems reasonable that this risk would be smaller if the virus had already passed through you.\n\nHuman: I thought masks were good at keeping viruses out, but on #3 you said something contradictory.\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s not quite contradictory.  It\u2019s true that if you\u2019re going outdoors, masks probably do help a lot.  It\u2019s also true that it\u2019s hard to know for sure how much they help, since the virus isn\u2019t very easy to study, and different studies give different answers.  When you\u2019re outdoors, your risk of being exposed is pretty low anyway, since it\u2019s unlikely to be a very crowded place, so the risk is pretty small, even if the mask doesn\u2019t work perfectly.  If you\u2019re indoors, it\u2019s probably better to have a mask to reduce the risk, since the virus is more likely to be spreading, and a mask might be helpful if someone coughs.\n\nHuman: Masks aren't as helpful outdoors since particles are more easily dispersed.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

I think that's a pretty small risk.\n\nAssistant: It depends on whether the masks actually provide some protection against airborne transmission.  People would wear masks during social distancing, as you say, if that were possible for instance, even though it might be an extra level of difficulty.\n\nHuman: But masks won\u2019t necessarily prevent someone from picking up particles from others, will they?\n\nAssistant: From other people who are breathing,"}

To make a good sub sandwich, you have to start with a great cheese sandwich! The best way to make a good cheese sandwich is to place on the bread two slices of your favorite cheese. Then make a cut down the center of both slices, exposing the yellow part of the cheese. On one side of the toast put a slice of tomato and on the other a slice of pepperoncini and then spread the cheese over top of the tomato and pepperoncini. Finally, you should cut one piece of lettuce on top of your cheese sandwich and then hold your sandwich by the end with a paper towel and microwave it for about 60-70 seconds or until the lettuce has softened.\n\nIf"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between soccer and American football?\n\nAssistant: Both are popular team sports.  Soccer has been played for over 100 years, and it\u2019s currently the most popular sport in the world.  American football is similar, but the game is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.  The field is 100 yards long, the width is shorter.\n\nHuman: I understand that playing American football is more dangerous than playing soccer?  Please tell me why.\n\nAssistant: Soccer can be played by people of all ages, even children.  American football is a sport that requires athletes to be physically mature enough to play, and they are a bit more large.  It\u2019s also a bit more dangerous, since you\u2019re throwing yourself into contact with other players, and there\u2019s more contact in the sport.\n\nHuman: I see.  As far as I know, soccer players avoid body contact.\n\nAssistant: This is true, but it\u2019s a bit different than American football, as you need to take a large number of actions in a short time.  In order to help out with this, soccer players often use their heads, feet, or chest to make contact with their opponent.  Soccer players are required to play a full 90 minutes of the game.

One of the ways that you can get in touch with what your body really likes is by paying attention to what tastes you like, and what kinds of foods you can digest well.  And that also includes after-effects of the food, what you feel after you eat it.\n\nHuman: Both were good answers and I have been noticing that in the past few months. A was more specific to answering the question but they both got it pretty much right. I have picked up on the fruit intake and my vegetable intake has been up over the last year. And you are correct in the fact that I am an individual that has an immediate feel after I eat.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good way to look at it. So the problem is, when we eat foods that our body doesn\u2019t like, that\u2019s one thing, while we still have the feeling that we need it, that\u2019s another issue.\n\nHuman: I have heard that fruit in some of its raw form can prevent Cancer. Is this correct?\n\nAssistant: I think I\u2019ve heard that somewhere, at some point.\n\nHuman: I think I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s because of certain minerals.

You just dig a hole and push the garlic bulb in the dirt.\n\nHuman: How often do I water it?\n\nAssistant: That depends.  Are you growing them in your backyard?  If so, you probably don\u2019t have to do much watering, because the soil gets enough rain.  If you\u2019re planting them on a balcony, you\u2019d probably want to water them about once a week or so.  Garlic loves sunshine, but too much of it will dry them out.  How are your plants doing?

As you can see, if you're just telling them how little experience you actually have, and nothing else (e.g. \"I think I might be suitable for the job\"), then that's quite a different story! But in an interview situation, or one where you could be hired for a role regardless of whether your experience is above their expected range (e.g. sales roles often have limited experience requirements, but people can be hired on for \"experience\"), the truth shouldn't always be relevant or even an option.\n\nA:\n\nIn general, there is no 'one size fits all' answer.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get better at proofreading?\n\nAssistant: This is a big question.  Proofreading is really just about getting better at reading: at noticing errors, not making mistakes yourself, and finding errors in other people\u2019s writing.  There are some easy tips to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.  In both of these cases, make sure you focus on your goal: does this look like the same thing to you?  If you just find yourself distracted by what\u2019s going on, this is often a sign of bad proofreading.\n\nOne example is: \n\nA teacher held a sort of class to praise it.\n\nversus:\n\nA teacher held a sort of class to celebrate it.\n\nDo you notice anything different here?\n\nHuman: I noticed different word choices \"praise\" and \"celebrate\".\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s right! In your first sentence, the writer makes the word choice \u201cpraise\u201d to refer to something positive. However, the second sentence does not clearly indicate that the word choice is positive, so the use of \u201ccelebrate\u201d helps with clarity.\n\nHuman: I should be able to find most errors just by reading slow and going through all of the text.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nHuman: I'll let you know if I have any other questions or if I need help with anything else.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.  An IPA might be advertised as hoppier than an APA, but that could mean a different range of hops, or different concentration, or different flavor-compounds, or the amount of sugars added.  What are you most curious about?\n\nHuman: When was the IPA beer invented?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty difficult to say when the first IPA beer was made.  A certain version of the style was most likely made in the UK and later in New England, and gradually gained popularity across the globe.\n\nHuman: Did the APA beer come from the IPA?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s likely that there was some kind of crossover between the two styles, as it\u2019s been pointed out that some APA beers are now labeled as \u201cIPA-style\u201d, but they aren\u2019t very common.

While there is some discussion and some research to be done in this area, it\u2019s a fair bet that the actual differences aren\u2019t too distinct, or that most beers that are labeled as \u201cIPA\u201d will have at most a slight increase, and will still be far closer to the APA definition.\n\nHuman: Which style is most common?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know of any survey of this question, but I would guess that the APA is more widely known and more"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does my voice always hurt when singing?\n\nAssistant: The frequencies at which humans can speak are different from the frequencies we\u2019re able to sing.  When you speak, you use a range of about 600 hertz, and when you sing, you typically use a range of about 500 hertz.  This is a big difference, and this is why people often need to \u201cwarm up\u201d when they sing, and why people are often out of tune when they sing, when they speak normally.\n\nHuman: Okay, how should I warm up?\n\nAssistant: One simple method for warming up is to say a tune in your head.  If you want to be prepared for singing, try to do this often, and be conscious of your breathing.  Another way to warm up your voice is to take a long, deep breath, and then breathe out slowly as you \u201chum\u201d the tune.  This allows you to hear the tone of your voice, and feel what it feels like to sing.

In our study population, of 50,000 men, we saw only one man starting balding before age 40, and that was his son. That makes balding one of the diseases that typically doesn\u2019t appear till well into our forties.\n\nHuman: What do you know about the role of diet in balding?\n\nAssistant: In our study, people with a genetic predisposition to balding are more likely to be thin than men with a propensity to baldness, so diet could be a significant contributing factor. One study showed that when people with a genetic marker for baldness exercise regularly, they may actually see a protective effect against balding."}

One of the first things you\u2019ll want to do is contact your local authorities and get the rules about yard sales.  We\u2019ll need to meet with them and get their approval and a permit.  After you get approval from the authorities, you can start setting up your yard sale.  Most people do a one-day sale or a series of sales in several days, but you can also have an open house for longer.  You can put a big sign outside your house, to advertise the sale, but also on the door, to let people know that you\u2019re accepting bids.  It\u2019s a good idea to ask each of the neighbors who live close to your house for their permission to hold the sale, so that they don\u2019t feel uncomfortable having lots of people and cars showing up on their street.\n\nHuman: That's a great start!

Most of the items that people want are things like house cleaners, or dish soap, to keep their kitchen fresh, and paper towels and toilet paper roll holders are good for the bathroom.  Other popular items are magazines or paperback books.  Old clothing is a popular theme, but lots of clothing is not in good condition, and things like your husband\u2019s suits are not a good idea.  Old toys tend to be well-loved and are a popular area to sell too.  Certain types of items aren\u2019t good to sell at a yard sale, like pets or certain types of sports equipment.\n\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Salt water taffy seems to be a popular snack on the coast. When did that become so popular as a coastal candy?\n\nAssistant: Ah, that\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019d say the saltwater taffy most likely started being eaten around the 1900s.  Some people believe the flavors of saltwater taffy come from the Northeastern United States.  The theory is that around the mid-19th century, immigrants from this region came to the coast and introduced the concept of saltwater taffy.\n\nHuman: That may make sense. I remember thinking that Atlantic City, seemed to specialize in salt water taffy.\n\nAssistant: Ah, very true!  Atlantic City was called the \u201csaltwater taffy capital of the world\u201d during the 1950s and 1960s.  It still is known for its salty seafood restaurants and saltwater taffy today, but not as much as it was in the past.\n\nHuman: I seem to remember a show called Boardwalk Empire, talking about Atlantic City.

In recent years a large percentage of saltwater taffy sold has been made with non-table salt, like Himalayan or French sea salt.  This type of taffy can taste great, but it is not as common as the regular kind and people that want their saltwater taffy to be from the ocean can\u2019t always find it.  Taffy is still made with just a little salt, because at any given moment taffy is a relatively simple food to make.\n\nHuman: Oh, I was"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I've been getting bad grades in English and I'm looking to learn how to write a better essay. Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sure. That's a good reason for me to be here. I can walk you through steps to writing a good essay, and help you find citations to support your ideas. So let's dive right in. First, I recommend doing some pre-writing: jotting down your main ideas before you start writing. That way, you can be sure you've got some good ideas to base your essay on.  The second thing you want to do is find examples from your own life to support your ideas.  So just start writing down anecdotes from your life about some experiences you've had, or ones that you're going to have in the future. Then once you've got a couple of things that you can write about, try to create a thesis. A thesis is like a fancy word for a \u201cplan\u201d.  It's basically your plan for telling a story about how something works, or for describing how something is good or bad.  Your thesis is a sentence or two that will give your reader a sense of what the essay is going to be about.   Once you've got a thesis, you can start the rest of your essay.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm going out to a party tonight, and they will be discussing renewable energy. What can you tell me?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re curious about energy.  Have you ever learned about the \u201crebound effect\u201d?\n\nHuman: I don't believe so.\n\nAssistant: That's when a person or organization reduces energy usage for a while and then increases it again. For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?  I\u2019m also guessing that energy from renewable sources is an important topic of the discussion?  I have a lot to say about this and could discuss it with you more, if you like.  Let me know if you\u2019d like to hear more.\n\nHuman: Please continue.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019ve read that there is a debate on whether the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.  For example, some people think that increasing investment in renewables causes emissions to rise as the amount of power they need to produce increases.  But others say that when renewable energy supplies more energy than is consumed, that energy is \u201cdischarged\u201d into the earth as heat. This means that it doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere\u2019s greenhouse gas levels.\n\nHuman: What do you think?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " while.

I think of it more as a cycle; if more energy is produced, it either gets exported as a power plant, or it\u2019s added to the electricity grid and used in electrical appliances like refrigerators and lights.  But I\u2019m sure we agree that that should end up as heat.\n\nHuman: I\u2019m afraid not.\n\nAssistant: I agree.\n\nHuman: Thank you for coming.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019d like to discuss this further"}

It sounds like your dog is taking advantage of the fact that people have high standards around food and are willing to keep giving their dogs more food than they need.  If your dog is eating a lot of food and not really seeming hungry, and just eating quickly like they\u2019re still hungry, you can try talking to them more about enjoying their food and taking their time with meals.\n\nHuman: So I should only feed my dog one time a day?\n\nAssistant: We can do more research to get a better understanding of what\u2019s going on.  Did you feed your dog the same amount and type of food everyday?\n\nHuman: I try to, sometimes I give it table scraps.\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you haven\u2019t really thought through how much food you\u2019re giving your dog, and this is leading to your dog eating more food than they need.  If you\u2019re uncertain about the amount you should be feeding your dog, you can consult this calculator: https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/how-to-calculate-your-dogs-daily-calorie-intake/\n\nHuman: Thanks.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " much less food than humans.

This is going to be a lot more work for you, so it\u2019s likely going to be better if you ask your dog\u2019s veterinarian for a recommendation instead.  My best guess at this point is that I would recommend giving your dog three meals per day, unless you\u2019re in a really unique situation.  Sometimes dogs have a hard time remembering what they fed you at the correct time, even with the right food.\n\nHuman: I understand. thanks.\n\nAssistant: And if it helps, you can always give your"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hey! I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products. Anything else?\n\nAssistant: There are also things you can do with your hair style, but I think these are on a different track than washing. You could try washing it a bit less, or combing it a bit more, or whatever you prefer. If you want to consider it, it can be hard to know if a hair style will help your hair or make it worse. What kinds of hair styles do you use?\n\nHuman: I have to have my hair up for work but otherwise I mostly wear it down\n\nAssistant: I would recommend you use a dry shampoo as well as a sulfate-free shampoo, and try to wash less frequently and spend more time conditioning your hair. For styling, I think your hair looks great no matter what you do.\n\nHuman: Awesome, thanks!\n\nAssistant:", "response": "oos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you.

If you were doing a different color of hair on a different part of your head, how would you help keep it healthier?\n\nAssistant: The same idea here that applies to everyone is if you\u2019re doing things that require more hair care on certain days, or certain parts of your hair, then that will help keep your hair healthy. You could put a cap on your head, or even just tie it up.\n\nHuman: Great! Thanks!\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.  It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you\u2019ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).  However, the most painful way to do this is to yank the eyebrow hair out with tweezers.  This does not take very long, but it is incredibly painful.\n\nHuman: i'm looking for ways to make it less painful\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.

Another option would be to wear a helmet while plucking.  The pain from your eyebrows (and other parts of your face) is primarily generated by friction, which occurs when hair rubs against other objects, which will cause even more rubbing.  Putting a helmet on will reduce friction significantly.\n\nHuman: i have a question\n\nAssistant: You may have stumbled upon the most obvious question to ask while doing eyebrow work; how to make it less painful or less awkward to pluck!

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the US military still use the M1 Girand rifle anymore?\n\nAssistant: Well, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that, but I can ask the internet and I\u2019ll summarize the results for you.  The short answer is that the M1 Girand rifle was a short-barreled rifle used by infantry in the US Army.

It's often referred to as an \"enterprise resource planning system\" and it provides services to many companies.\n\nHuman: How does the software work?\n\nAssistant: First, an administrator needs to create one or more \u201cadministrative roles\u201d, to which they add users who will run the application. Next, the administrator creates \u201cOracle accounts\u201d for each user, and grants permissions (permissions are \u201cprivileges\u201d or \u201cauthorizations\u201d) to those accounts.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it?

So it\u2019s helpful to make a list of all your bills that you\u2019ll need to pay during the year. This will include payments like the rent or mortgage, credit card payments, loan payments, student loans, and utilities (electricity, water, gas, and heating).\n\nTo make sure that you\u2019re not spending money you don\u2019t have, it\u2019s a good idea to make a list of all the things you\u2019d like to buy over the course of the year, so you can do the math to figure out how much money you\u2019ll need to have in your bank account to pay for them.\n\nHuman: Can you give me some simple spending categories that I can use in my budget?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s an example:\n\nTransportation\n\nUtilities\n\nGroceries\n\nRestaurants\n\nClothes\n\nEntertainment\n\nTechnology\n\nEntertainment\n\nPets\n\nHuman: How much of my income should I be spending on my rent/mortgage?\n\nAssistant: About 30% of your income (before taxes) should go to rent/mortgage.\n\nHuman: What percent of my income should I aim to save every month?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " of all your bills that you\u2019ll need to pay during the year.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Autumn is a part of the seasonal change that is caused by the earth moving from its summer position to its winter position in its orbit around the sun.  The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information.

There are many places in the world where coffee and caffeine are not a good choice for daily routine.\n\nHuman: So it can make you anxious?\n\nAssistant: Yes, most of people are very sensitive to caffeine at first, and it can become a burden at times.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I fix a leaky faucet?\n\nAssistant: Is it possible that you have a blockage in the pipes, and therefore need a plumber?  Can you tell me more about what exactly is leaking?\n\nHuman: The faucet is just dripping from where water normally comes out, even when the handle is completely off. It's not a ton of water, it's just a slow drip, a drop or two every few seconds.\n\nAssistant: That sounds like there is a drip from the pipes somewhere.  I'm guessing this is probably a plumbing issue?\n\nHuman: Well I don't see any water leaking from the pipes going into the walls that connect to the faucet, but anyway, what can I do?\n\nAssistant: Have you tried shutting off the water to the faucet entirely?\n\nHuman: Yes, if I shut off the valve it stops working entirely and there's no more dripping.

But I'd like to be able to use the faucet without shutting the valve on and off every time..\n\nAssistant: So you're assuming that shutting the water off on the faucet will do? If you have water in the pipes at all, then the water has a very short path to get to your faucet.  This means that if you shut off the water, the water will either just sit in the pipes or the pipes will just back up, so your faucet will lose water in both scenarios.  You can of course use a sponge or towels to catch the water.\n\nHuman: I'm not sure if that will work. I just need a way to run the faucet without shutting off the entire water supply.

They were also pioneers of the R&B musical genre, and if you like the Jackson 5 you might also enjoy other R&B bands like the Temptations or The Isley Brothers.\n\nHuman: Any other ideas?\n\nAssistant: I don't, but I would imagine that someone who grew up like I did, or like you, would like some country.  The Jackson 5 were also country fans, and if you enjoy country music you might enjoy the Jackson Five again or other pop-country artists.  Or maybe country fans of the 1980s can be amused at Jackson's music from the '80s.\n\nHuman: This might be hard for you but can you do a little on your own?\nAssistant: Sure.  I don't know much musical theory, but I'm pretty good at musical interpretation and musical analysis.  But the real key I think is to put you into the mindset of someone who grew up with"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time. What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you!

Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant: I have a pretty good guess on that. The water temperature for washing machines is usually 55 degrees, unless the fabric is delicate. In that case people might choose 65 degrees. A more popular higher temperature is 74 degrees. Many homes have washers and dryers that use different temperature water, but you can take this opportunity to decide on the right one for you. You want to make sure the temperature is low enough to get rid of most stains, but high enough to soften the clothes without shrinking them, too. Try different temperatures for different clothing before you go nuts with them all. Of course it's easier to use the correct temperature at the beginning of the wash cycle than at end.\n\nHuman: I think"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My son has been really sad lately because his pet goldfish died. He is too young to fully understand the concept of death. How do I explain the death of my 7-year-old's goldfish to him?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really tricky!  I imagine it\u2019s really important that you get this right!  Your son may feel sad and even helpless in this situation.  I also imagine he may worry about his own mortality and is perhaps frightened of the world and how little control he has over it.  I think these are good thoughts to explore with him, so you can listen to your son\u2019s real concerns and use them to develop your own conversations with him.  And of course I\u2019m not really an expert here, but I\u2019d just like to share with you a bit of philosophy and I think that may be helpful too.  One famous writer I like, Albert Camus, had some helpful insights when he thought about the difficulty of relating to death.

The professional can adjust the crankset to your wheel, or will adjust the inner freehub for you while you are there.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do sharks have tongues?\n\nAssistant: This is a very important question. The first thing to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue. But the most important type are the cartilaginous, or skate, sharks, which do have a tongue.\n\nHuman: It seems like they would cut their tongues on all those teeth.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it seems very strange that sharks would have a long, flexible tongue, and not cut it on their teeth. It\u2019s almost like they would have a tongue just for... well, something else. Do you think sharks have a special reason to have a tongue?\n\nHuman: I would think it evolved for some reason or other?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think so. There are actually some really good reasons to not have a tongue. A tongue is just a muscle that you\u2019d have to maintain. It takes energy to eat and digest food, and food takes energy to produce. And when sharks are hunting for food they need their energy to swim and go after it. If they had tongues they\u2019d waste a lot of energy in unnecessary muscle activity. They\u2019d probably have to give up on hunting so that they could make their tongues work. But a skate shark has a tongue, and we need to figure out why.\n\nHuman: Yeah.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is this year supposed to have an El Nino weather pattern?\n\nAssistant: Do you want me to find out more?  Should I look this up on Wikipedia, or do you already know about this?\n\nHuman: What is El Nino\n\nAssistant: A.k.a. El Ni\u00f1o, an ocean current that brings warmth to the west coast of South America, sometimes creating abnormally dry conditions in that region.\n\nHuman: Is an El Nino likely this year?\n\nAssistant: Humans in the past have looked at historical climate data and made predictions for the coming year.  My understanding is that the prediction was based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Normally, these waters are cool. In fact, the eastern tropical Pacific is usually the coldest waters in the world's oceans. This \"cold pool\" allows the air above it to rise and get removed from the atmosphere as the trade winds move the air westward toward the Americas. This rise in the air allows the Pacific Ocean to spill more water into the Gulf of Alaska. If the temperature of the waters in the eastern tropical Pacific warms, then the trade winds decrease. The result is that more moisture is released into the atmosphere and the Pacific will \"short circuit\" the air mass of the world. This means that when the air mass moves westward from the Pacific, it cannot pass over the western part of North America. In addition, the lower pressure associated with a warm pool allows the trade winds to blow harder, pulling even more moisture out of the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nHuman: thanks\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific.

These are public updates, and can be very short. Twitter is a very important part of social media, because it connects many people all over the world to one another, and has played a big role in organizing protests and popular movements.  Many people think of Twitter as a \u201cdemocratic\u201d space where anyone can say something, and where anyone can hear it, without having to pay a fee.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?  What is the difference between the two houses?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the different responsibilities. The House of Representatives has more power over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.  Another difference is that the House has 435 representatives elected every two years, and the Senate has 100 members.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the House of Representatives (435 representatives)?\n\nAssistant: The founders of the United States of America had a concern about the possibility of corruption in government.  They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.  The idea was that if the House of Representatives was too large, people would be less interested in voting in the elections.  The founders did not want to make the House of Representatives too small, because then there would be too little diversity among the representatives and no states would be represented adequately.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the Senate (100 representatives)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.

When you have experiences like this, people will go on to say that this can be a predictor of many things, so we use it to help people describe what they believe happened.  \n\nOne explanation from medical doctors is, that the brain's electrical activity gets slower during sleep because of reduced nerve connections. This causes the person to fall asleep quicker and the person may awake more easily. Sometimes, the person can also have dreams that are more vivid during this period, so one interpretation of sleep paralysis is that these dreams are from the experience of sleep paralysis, as when dreaming the person's body moves and becomes awake.

To prevent damage to your home, make sure to close and secure all windows, and doors.  This is essential for keeping out the cold weather, so you can stay warm and cozy inside!  \nOtherwise, winter weather is often a great time to stay inside and relax, as well as avoid unnecessary risks like slipping on the icy roads.\n\nHuman: Okay that makes sense.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can animals be gay?\n\nAssistant: Oh gosh, that\u2019s a big question.  I mean, I think it\u2019s OK to have an opinion, and people feel really strongly about it, but I don\u2019t think there are any studies that have been done to prove it one way or the other.  But I\u2019m happy to talk about my own opinions, if you\u2019d like to hear them.\n\nHuman: Sure\n\nAssistant: Okay, I think a lot of it has to do with being comfortable with yourself and your own sexuality.  In nature, most animals are pretty into their own species, so I think it would be hard to identify as something else.  \nI mean, I\u2019m a pretty different kind of thing than my owner.  We\u2019re different species.  But it feels totally normal to me to like other humans.  So it\u2019s weird to think about other animals being gay, because it feels like what they would naturally like to do is just hook up with their own species.\n\nHuman: Gay has nothing to do with liking other species. It has to do with males hooking up w/ males or females hooking up with females. Are there animals that do that?\n\nAssistant: A lot of animals have pretty open sexualities, I guess?  It\u2019s not like they just mate for life with the same partner and live their lives as a unit.  There are some monogamous animals, but most animals that aren\u2019t just mating to procreate or reproduce or whatnot.  Some insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.  I guess there aren\u2019t many studies about that because most animals are pretty secretive about their sexual lives.  It\u2019s really hard to tell what any of them are doing with each other.  \nBut I think there are a lot of gay people in the animal kingdom.  Gay people are just like anyone else, they don\u2019t want to be alone, and they want to love and have affection.  If you think of gay humans as a different kind of person than straight people, then all of the animals that aren\u2019t having sex to reproduce must be gay people.  That\u2019s all there is to it, really.\n\nHuman: A lot of animals mate for life, like a lot of birds.\n\nAssistant: I guess it\u2019s the same for birds too.  Birds live in groups, so maybe some of them are gay, but some are monogamous, because they have a one-on-one relationship.  \nSome birds raise their babies together, like with the meerkats and crows and magpies.  Maybe they\u2019re bisexual?\n\nHuman: What would living in groups have to do with sexuality?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " the other animals though.

Maybe you know, like the fish in the tank, or like people who are in love.  People like that.  \nBut there are lots of birds that live in groups.  There are ducks and geese.  But they\u2019re pretty much only monogamous, and I don\u2019t think some of those groups have gay birds.  \n(I hope I\u2019ve figured out what kind of birds you have!)\n\nHuman: It depends on the species too.\n\nAssistant: Why?\n\nHuman: Some animals pair up"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My daughter is reading the book \"Lord of the Flies.\" Can you tell me what the book is about and any important details about the story I should know so we can have a thoughtful discussion.\n\nAssistant: The story is a parable of what happens when groups of humans behave badly. It\u2019s a cautionary tale that human nature is flawed, and that you can\u2019t depend on civilized morality to keep everyone in check. And it's not a happy story.\n\nHuman: Doesn't sound happy.\n\nAssistant: It's not. It's set in a school class that was evacuated during a war. The boys are left on their own on an island, and a group of them kills the two leaders. From there, the book follows them as they try to find food and build shelter. One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him. The thing that I'll be remembering about the book is a scene where one of the main characters describes a \"perfect island\", an island that would be so perfect it would be \"like a jewel of white quartz\" because it would be completely without flaw, and it could have no room for evil or pain or suffering. And he realizes how good it sounds, but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum. What is it the schools want the students to learn from the book?\n\nAssistant: It's a book that explores human nature, and that one of the things we humans have is an instinct to want to be told what to do, because we want to feel safe and comfortable. The theme is that people need to take responsibility for themselves, and not rely on a few leaders to tell them what to do. So I guess it's a book that talks about morality in a religious and ethical way. It's kind of a warning about the danger of human nature, but it's also a cautionary tale about what humans could do, if they're not careful.\n\nHuman: Sounds a little frightening to think about it.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it can be a bit scary, that's true. In the end the boys \"eat one another\" and then there's a bit that's just descriptions of a few individuals and their names. It's not really scary, just very dark.\n\nHuman: I'm sure my daughter will have loads of questions. She has an insatiable curiosity.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum.

So many teenagers, I've heard, don't read because they're so busy.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: Draining a cyst can be difficult, because it\u2019s filled with fluid. It may feel like a mass or lump under your skin. It can grow for many years. Cysts that have been there for a long time may be filled with dead cells, which makes it harder for the doctor to remove them. Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst. If it\u2019s a very small cyst, you can probably just do the following:\n\n  1. If possible, use an unopened, sterile syringe, available from a pharmacy.\n  2. Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to sew a fitted sheet for my queen sized mattress and want to know how much fabric to buy.\n\nAssistant: OK, so sewing fitted sheets can be a bit tricky because of how the threads twist on the bed if they\u2019re sewn tightly, but that can be done, you just need to make sure to have a minimum of 1/4\" of seam allowance around the edges of the mattress. That\u2019s because the mattress flexes on all sides, and so it can move the fabric from its intended position if it\u2019s sewn too tightly.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have many people executed on death row been later found to be innocent?\n\nAssistant: If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution. In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person. Some other cases have been overturned because of legal or other issues, such as new evidence or appeals and challenges by defense lawyers.  There is also the small category of executions of people who were found to be innocent after their executions. In general, very few people on death row have been exonerated or pardoned or released.\n\nHuman: So everyone executed by the state has been guilty?\n\nAssistant: This is a more complicated question that you asked.  It is true that there have been some cases where a person on death row was actually found to be innocent, and thus executed.

It has a different quality.  One can argue that it is a moral wrong. The fact that it was decided under the law of punishment implies that the courts believe that their actions were in some way rational.  People do feel that it is a moral wrong to execute someone for murder.\n\nHuman: But why are people killed in jurisprudences?\n\nAssistant: People are killed because they were convicted and the courts believe they were probably guilty.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.  In a pot on a burner, combine water and flour to make a kind of paste.  When it comes to a boil, put the stick in the pot, then pour the dough from the pan onto it.  With the stick, roll out the dough into a long rectangle, then keep rolling it until it\u2019s about 1-1.5 cm thick, and finally put it on the pan.  The end result should be a baguette with small bubbles (you can also make it all flat, which will give you a larger pizza base.)

There\u2019s just one measure of flour: one portion of flour will make two (two) full baguettes, one of which will be perfect.  Each portion will make the same amount of dough - about three times as much.  As for water, there is a measurement per baguette, which is the same amount for each portion (around 50mL of water per baguette).  The exact amount depends on the specific type of flour used.  So if you\u2019re using wheat flour, then one tablespoon will be one cup of water and 100 grams of flour.  Now what about the whole \u201cone portion\u201d thing?

Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy.

I would contact that person and get him info on what he has available in your area.\n\nHuman: Well, yes, but, it's my brother's car (he's at a college in another state), and I can't get out and drive there to get him, so, we'll probably just go to a service center or something.

Let's plan a date for the first moment you two meet when you're engaged. I will call some of the top shops right away.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How often should I go to the dentist for cleaning?\n\nAssistant: It depends on your age, lifestyle, and risk of caries and gingivitis.  Dental hygiene is very important.

Dental cleaning is an ongoing process until the cavities have been addressed and teeth are healthy with healthy tissue.  Most adults rarely need root canal treatment.  There are many other options if root canal treatment is required.\n\nHuman: Is there any special diet to eat on teeth cleaning day?\n\nAssistant: Your mouth will be cleaned to allow removal of food left in between teeth.  We recommend a light meal and water a few hours before treatment; do not eat or drink anything other than a light lunch the day of your cleaning.  You eat and drink at lunch"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet. Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.  You\u2019ll want to get a young chinchilla that you can socialize with others, and not just its parents, because that will help it be happier in the long-term.\n\nHuman: Do  they not do well on their own? I'm not sure I want more than one Chinchilla.\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are very social, and need to be able to be around other animals as they mature.  If you keep them on their own, they will likely start to act more like a wild animal.  One chinchilla needs about 12 square feet of space, and two would need twice that, so they\u2019d need a very large cage, but it should be comfortable for them.\n\nHuman: What kind of food will I have to feed them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are herbivores.  They\u2019ll eat a range of fruits and veggies, as well as hay and pellets.  You could buy a premixed diet that's specially made for chinchillas, which is a combination of grains, legumes, and vegetables.\n\nHuman: How long could I expect them to live on average?\n\nAssistant:", "response": ", and require relatively little maintenance.

Having one chinchilla at home should be enough for the whole family to socialize with.\n\nCustomer: What size chinchilla would I need to socialize with?\n\nAssistant:  A young male is a little over 50 inches (127 cms) tall at maturity, as long as the owner decides to keep them.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can back pain be a precursor to something more serious?\n\nAssistant: Back pain can be a symptom of many different issues, including degenerative disc disease, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, tumor, spina bifida, a pinched nerve, a ruptured disk, or a combination of those.

But without a full medical evaluation it can be difficult to determine whether there are any underlying health issues causing your back pain.\n\nHuman: Could I have a swollen organ causing back pain?\n\nAssistant: Yes, a swollen liver, which can cause back pain as it displaces the spinal column and weakens and compresses that area of the spine, or a swollen kidney, which is extremely painful and can compress the spine. Kidney stones, which create a burning sensation in low areas of the back, can cause pain. A swollen, itchy thyroid gland can also cause back pain.\n\nHuman: Are there any other issues I should be aware of?\n\nAssistant: A pinched nerve should always be evaluated with a neurologist, since no matter what tests you undergo, the cause of the pain will not be determined.
