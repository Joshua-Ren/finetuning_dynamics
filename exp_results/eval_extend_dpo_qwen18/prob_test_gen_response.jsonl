{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant: Sure, turkeys were once a common part of the Thanksgiving meal because they were very tame and domesticated animals.  They were kept for their meat, which was a favorite part of the Thanksgiving table.  However, there is a deeper reason why turkeys became a Thanksgiving dish:  In the 1800s, the first Thanksgiving meal in the United States was held to celebrate the signing of the American Flag.  In this meal, turkeys were served, along with bread and beer.  Over time, the Thanksgiving meal became richer and better, and now we eat lots of turkey and pumpkin or other fruits and vegetables."}

Sometimes cats will fight when they were marginally stressed earlier, and they repeatedly practiced the fight in order to reduce the stress.  You could try repeating the fight again later, to see if they reduce the stress and are less aggressive.  But sometimes they fight because they just really like to fight.  If this happens a lot, I could suggest taking the cats to a professional to see if they can figure out why they\u2019re fighting so much, and maybe how to help the cats become less aggressive.

How do I make a pumpkin pie?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to make a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, but I've never made one before.  How do I make a pumpkin pie?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  First you'll want to seed a pumpkin and cut it in half, then remove the pumpkin's stem and seeds.  You'll then mix together 6 cups of sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/4 cup cornstarch, and 1/4 tsp salt in a bowl.  This mixture makes the pumpkin pie's crust.  Next, put the cut pumpkin halves back together and spoon the mixture into the pumpkin.  You can also put the pumpkin in a food processor and process it until it's mixed up, which is also a good option if you don't have a bowl to mix in a spoon.  Use an ice cream scoop or spoon to scoop the pumpkin mixture into the prepared pie shell.  Bake the pumpkin at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes, or until it's set.  You can test if it's done by piercing it with a knife.  It should come out clean.  Let the pumpkin cool, then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours to firm up.  Once it's at room temperature you can serve it for Thanksgiving!  Enjoy!"}

It began with a series of events following the Egyptian revolution of 1918, which led to the overthrow of the Aliyev dynasty in Turkey and the establishment of a republic under Mustafa Ataturk.  The war is historically known for its military campaigns that took place in 1919 and 1922.  The major military campaigns involved the forces of the Ottoman Empire, which had been fighting against the advancing republic of Turkey since the fall of the empire in 1922.  Ataturk tried to stem the expansion of the republic by launching a series of counter-campaigns, most notably the Battle of Rive Gauche in France in 1924 and the Battle of Bitter Lake in China in 1925.  The republic gained control of most of southeastern Turkey in 1922.  The 1920s also saw a period of unrest in Turkey, including the rising of the political movement called the Kemalist Parties."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is it important to get plenty of vitamins in your diet, and how best to go about this?\n\nAssistant: I think most people need a lot of vitamins, but that usually comes from eating food rather than from supplements.  What sort of vitamins are you looking to get?  Vitamin A, C, E, D, and B vitamins are especially important.  What foods do you eat?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'd like to make sure that I'm getting enough of the essential vitamins from the food that I buy. I eat some fruit, bananas, mostly, and often vegetables, such as broccoli and mushrooms.

You can also eat lots of colored vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Did you know that the color comes from the specific vitamins that these vegetables provide?  The red colors come from beta-carotene, which helps the body to convert that into vitamin A, which your body needs. \nThis is just one example of the importance of eating the whole vegetable, including all of its colors.  In general, it\u2019s important to get lots of different kinds of colorful vegetables in your diet.  And you can also add beans and nuts to your diet.\n\nHuman: Great.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!  Historians agree that American governance traces back to British ideas about a separation of powers and mixed monarchy.  The US Constitution draws a lot from the English.\n\nHuman: So France didn't have much influence?\n\nAssistant: That is correct.  France's best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.  It also became the standard source of many US legal terms and concepts, and so the US adopted many French legal terms for the English translations, for example \"defense\" instead of \"de fense\".\n\nHuman: Did the U.S. approve upon the British system in any ways?\n\nAssistant: Americans wanted to copy British institutions such as a monarchy and a parliament, but they rejected the system as a whole.  The Americans wanted to be governed directly by the people through representative democracy, rather than through a bureaucracy.  Americans considered the British system to be corrupt and in need of reform, so they worked to re-invent it.\n\nHuman: That seems like a better way to do it.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!

But it's important to note that the U.S. did approve of some British ideas, for example the election of the leader (the king or queen in the\u82f1\u8054\u90a6) and the representation of different groups (the legislative branch) based on population."}

Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet. Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant: Of course!  A chinchilla is a small, relatively short-haired rodent native to the Andalusian region of Spain and southern France.  They're known for their intelligent nature and love of human company.  There are several varieties of chinchilla, all of which are generally short-coated, with white coats and very dense hair, although the more endangered Galera varieties have long fur.  Chinchillas are medium-sized rodents, weighing between 1 and 3 kilograms and standing 20 to 25 centimeters high, but vary in length from 14 to 28 centimeters."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I'd like to play ice hockey. Can you explain how the game works?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I'd like to play ice hockey. Can you explain how the game works?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can explain the rules of ice hockey pretty clearly!  First off, there are two teams of six players each, playing on long sticks and a net in the middle of the ice.  The goal of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team, in a set period of time called a \u201cgame period\u201d.  Each period is about ten minutes in duration, and each period ends when one team has scored seven goals.  At the end of the game, the team with fewer goals is the loser.  \nSo what happens in the middle of the game, between periods, when the team with fewer goals has to stop and wait for the other team to give up the ball, some sort of physical contact often involves fighting among the players.  This isn\u2019t a deliberate, calculated attack that ends up hurting the other team, but rather a defensive move to protect their own team, or even to hurt the opposition, by bumping, shoving, or hitting other players in order to gain an advantage.  These actions are called \u201cchecking\u201d, but they are also commonly called \u201cgrinding\u201d or \u201chitting\u201d.  It\u2019s not allowed, and the team that commits the hit will be penalized.  There\u2019s even a specific penalty called \u201chigh-hitting\u201d that is a harsher sanction and gives the referee more authority to call the check.  The team committing the hit will be cautioned, and their players will be warned.  \nIt can be really hard to play ice hockey, and it takes a lot of skill to be able to play it well!  But it is definitely worth it to play, it\u2019s a fun and challenging sport!"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Would you be able to explain the differences between the Spanish and Italian language?\n\nAssistant: Of course.  Can you tell me more about the specific areas where you\u2019re interested in knowing more?\n\nHuman: I'm thinking between the Spanish spoken in Mexico and Italian spoken in Italy.\n\nAssistant: Okay, great.  Well both Spanish and Italian come from the same language group, but they differ in many ways.  Spanish has a more rich vocabulary, whereas Italian has been described as \u201cless rich\u201d and \u201cmore concise.\u201d  For example, \u201canoche\u201d is a commonly used word in Spanish that means \u201clast night,\u201d whereas in Italian, \u201cieri\u201d is the word for that.  Of course, this is just one small example, so I could go into more detail about how these languages are different.\n\nHuman: Okay, please go into more detail about how they're different\n\nAssistant: Well, the syntax is similar, as both languages are members of the romance language group.  But there are a few other key differences.  For example, Italian has fewer word forms for the past tense, so it can be hard for people from Spanish-speaking countries to pick up Italian.\n\nHuman: Hm, okay. What else?\n\nAssistant: As far as vocabulary, I\u2019ve already mentioned one example.  Italian can be considered a more concise language, as the total word count is around half of that in Spanish.  And, Italian is considered to be \u201cmore rational\u201d, and thus less poetic, than Spanish.  Other differences include the greater number of Italian dialects, the historical-evolution aspect of Italian, the lack of a gender-neutral pronoun, and the Italian-language impact in the world.\n\nHuman: Got it!

However, hospitals and other places that see a lot of people who are very vulnerable, such as the elderly or very young children, may prefer that workers work nights.  This is because night shifts are often easier for workers to attend school or take care of family members, since it\u2019s easier to balance a job and school or family life around a daytime slot."}

If so, there are many different factors that can influence a bird's decision to visit your backyard, so let's start with a simple example and work our way up. What type of food do you eat?  Do you have fresh or dried food?  Are you a birdseed only type of person, or will you also feed your neighborhood friends blueberries and suet?  Do you cook for the birds, or just provide a spot for them to perch in your backyard?  Do you hang up feeders that dispense seeds or do they dispense food pouches that you drop from a pole?  What types of trees do you have around your backyard, and what types of birdseed do they hold?   All of these questions will help you figure out what specific steps you need to take in order to make your backyard more conducive to birdlife."}

Most karate classes will teach you the same five basic moves I listed earlier, but there are many other moves as well.  I recommend starting with the five basic moves, and adding on other moves as you get more comfortable with them.  You might find it helpful to practice these moves in different ways, like with blocks, blocks and defenders, and defenders only.  It\u2019s a fun way to learn to test yourself to see how well you can block.  Block and defend is also a good way to work on reaction times.  Have fun!"}

Remove the eyes and set the lobster free.\n2.  Run a sharp knife along the length of the tail, from the top of the body to the end.\n3.  This will separate the meat from the shell, leaving the meat inside the shell.\n4.  Flip the tail over so that the underside is also separated, leaving the meat inside.\n5.  Cut a \u2018T\u2019 shape in the tails, making a total of three cuts.\n6.  Put one tail in each of two pots, each with about 2 inches of water in it. \n7.   Add salt to the water, so that the lobster is going to swim in it.\n8.  Cook the tails on one side for 8-10 minutes, or until the meat inside is translucent.\n9.  Turn them over and cook on the other side for another minute or two.\n10.  When the meat is finished cooking, take the tails out and place them in warm water.\n\nIf you want to cook the lobster meat inside the shell, you\u2019ll just have to figure out how to do that, and you\u2019ll need to do that before you get to the steps to cook the tails on the side.  Lobster meat will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, or you could also freeze it for a long time.  I hope this helps!"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to learn more about the board game Monopoly.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m very glad you mentioned Monopoly. I know a lot about the game. It\u2019s actually about the history of capitalism.\n\nHuman: Who were the designers of the board game?\n\nAssistant: The designers were an American family. They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.  She worked on playing the game, and wrote down her observations in a little notebook. Charles used the information from her notebook to make adjustments to the game.  And they made money from\n\nHuman: What year was the game finally released to the public?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " had moved to Pennsylvania with her family.

It was based on a game that the two designers, Milton Bradley and Charles Darrow, created in the 1950s and 1960s.  They designed it several times before it reached a release in 1971.  The game was designed for children but the actual authors of the game were adults.  The game was also released in several European countries, but the United States is where it had the biggest following."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who is considered the best golf player of all time and why?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question because there are many dimensions to consider when evaluating a golf player. For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does \u201cbest\u201d refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others.\n\nHuman: Okay, interesting. I know he was really good for a few years but then went into a slump. Did you take that into account?\n\nAssistant: This is true, but the human ability to distinguish \u201cdown periods\u201d from \u201cslumps\u201d is surprisingly accurate. While our perceptions of when an athlete is performing well may not be perfectly accurate, in general our perception of the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d can be fairly good, as compared to other historical sports. For example, in the NBA, players like Lebron James and Michael Jordan are both recognized as the \u201cbest player of all time\u201d, despite Lebron\u2019s time in Miami (and his continued success in Cleveland) being viewed as a \u201cslump\u201d. If anything, we tend to undervalue Lebron because his best teams weren\u2019t all from Cleveland.\n\nHuman: Okay, I guess that makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " ranking in a list?

In the case of Jack Nicklaus, we\u2019d expect him to be one of the greatest golfers of all time, but he\u2019s also known for being one of the best golfers to have ever played the game.  So while the two are very different people, they are likely to be perceived as similar."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: You can buy property through a real estate agent or a realtor. There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash. In the U.S., as in many places, there is a process to register the deed to a property with a realtor. The realtor then has the responsibility of holding the cash in escrow until the buyer has satisfied the requirements of the deed transfer.\n\nHuman: I see. That makes sense. I assume the realtor of course would get something from helping both parties. How much do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price. In some states they are not allowed to charge any fee. The realtor can also be paid with a commission, and in that case the realtor may get a commission of 5% to 10% of the selling price.  There are also taxes, transaction fees, and closing costs.\n\nHuman: Does the buyer pay for those costs, or the seller?\n\nAssistant: Both parties pay for some of those.  For example, a buyer and seller both pay transaction fees for property transfers. But some fees can only be paid by one party, or only by the buyer.  The realtor will be able to explain in more detail.\n\nHuman: Thank you again. If say either the buyer or the seller wants to cancel the transaction, will there still be fees involved?\n\nAssistant: The seller may get some back if the sale doesn\u2019t close, but the buyer will have to pay a fee to the realtor in the form of a transaction fee if the sale falls through.\n\nHuman: I really appreciate your help.

Many other people also work out by themselves, and use online workout programs or personal trainers.  This is an easy and free way to build muscle, though if you want to do a certain workout in a set time period, you have to schedule the workout to fit into your schedule.

So you could go to a gym, buy some weights to lift, and just start lifting as heavy as you can.  You want to focus on getting stronger, not getting larger, so start with a weight that you can only lift a few times before you can\u2019t lift any more.  As you improve, you can gradually increase the weight you\u2019re lifting.  With some weights, you can even lift more than one time, but only if you are getting tired.  Most people improve their strength by about 25-30% each month, so you will need to be patient and diligent in your training."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do a lot of Scientists not believe in God or Satan?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why do a lot of Scientists not believe in God or Satan?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a complex question.  One reason is that many scientists don\u2019t feel that their approaches can give a complete or accurate account of reality.  Another reason is that scientists today often have a much simpler worldview than people in the past.  Here\u2019s a summary of some of the main reasons that scientists today often have a simpler worldview:\n\n1.  Science focuses on the physical world.  It does a good job explaining why things behave the way they do, but it doesn\u2019t do a good job explaining why people behave the way they do.  The only explanation it can give is that people have certain physical characteristics that make them capable of thinking and behaving in certain ways.\n\n2.  Science explains things in a cause-and-effect way.  It explains why things behave in certain ways by showing that previous things (causes) led to future things (behaviors).  But if science is wrong about how the physical world works, there is still a lot of room for things to happen by other causes, and future behaviors won\u2019t be predictable from past causes.\n\n3.  Science explains the world through a linear perspective.  Science explains the world by showing that the past, present, and future are connected.  So, if something happened in the past, it means that something else happened in the future.  But the past and present aren\u2019t the only connections: the present also has consequences for the future.  So the past, present, and future are connected in a very different way than you might expect.  For example, the present can\u2019t be affected by the past, and the present also doesn\u2019t predict the future.\n\n4.  Science explains how things behave in isolation.  Many things in the physical world behave in a very specific way, and the same thing will always behave in a specific way.  But many people have certain physical characteristics that make them capable of thinking and acting in certain ways.  So scientists today often conclude that the things behave in a specific way because people have certain physical characteristics.  This is called an \u201cisolated behavior model\u201d (IBM) or \u201cbehavioralist perspective\u201d (BP).  The IBM or BP explains things in a very simple way, and the simplistic explanations are very common.\n\n5.  Science explains that things behave in predictable ways.  Many scientists today will say things behave in a specific way because of an isolated behavior model, and it is a very simple explanation.  But there are many reasons things behave in a specific way that aren\u2019t explained by the isolated behavior model.  For example, people don\u2019t just have certain physical characteristics because of that.  It\u2019s more complicated than that, and it takes a lot of factors into account.  Sometimes people explain things in a specific way because they have a particular way of being or acting, and that way of being or acting is determined by certain internal and external factors, as well as the isolated behavior model."}

He was a seventeenth-century philosopher in Britain, and he has had the most influence on thinking about rights and responsibilities in Europe since then.  Some of the ideas in his work are still central to political philosophy today.\n\nLocke was interested in two main ideas:  how a person\u2019s \u201c\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\u201d \uff08natural rights\uff09 apply to other people, and how people can agree on what those rights are.  His ideas about rights have been influential in political philosophy for a while, but they are also very relevant to everyday life.  Here are a few examples:\n\nRights are something that people are born with.  They are not based on whether or not you \u201cwin\u201d someone else\u2019s consent.\n\nRights are special, absolute, and spiritual rights that everyone has.  People are naturally good, and should treat each other with kindness and respect.\n\nPeople can agree on what rights everyone should have, and the government\u2019s job is to protect those rights.\n\nI hope that helps you understand some of the ideas in Locke\u2019s philosophy.

One way is to add fish to the pond, because fish will eat the algae if they eat the fish that eat the algae.  You can also add fertilizer to the pond, which will cause the algae to grow more quickly.  Another way is to add chlorine to the pond, which will kill most of the algae and prevent it from growing in future treatments."}

Some people also like to plant beets, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for beginners.  Are you planting indoors or outside?\n\nHuman: I would be planting them outside in my backyard.\n\nAssistant: Well, outside is a better option, because with most of your plants, you\u2019ll get a better yield, and the harvest will be ready sooner.  So if you\u2019re planting indoors you might just plant seeds.

Some people also like to plant beets, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for beginners.  Are you planting indoors or outside?\n\nHuman: I would be planting them outside in my backyard.\n\nAssistant: Well, outside is a better option, because with most of your plants, you\u2019ll get a better yield, and the harvest will be ready sooner.  So if you\u2019re planting indoors you might just plant seeds.  If you\u2019re planting outside, you can plant transplants, which is the fastest way to get a plant up and growing.\n\nHuman: Would they be able to survive through the winter months?\n\nAssistant: Not normally, although there are varieties that are known to survive cold temperatures.

I\u2019m not sure how much gardening space you\u2019ve got already, but that should give you a good amount of room to plant your carrots."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me if Tigers are an endangered species anymore?\n\nAssistant: No, they are not endangered.

And can you tell me when they were removed from the endangered species list?\n\nAssistant: Sure, tigers were added to the endangered species list in 1970.  This was due to habitat loss and a decrease in prey populations, for example, as a result of poaching for their organs.  By removing them from the endangered list, we tried to allow for greater co-existence with humans.   This move was motivated by the desire to protect their habitat, and their prey populations.  However, tigers are still endangered and need protection."}

Some methods are more widely accepted than others, though.  The most widely accepted methods in the Western world are hormonal contraceptives, or pills, patches, injections, and injections (birth control shot).  Other methods are less widely accepted, like birth control suspensions or injections that contain hormones other than those in the pill, like the injection carrying the hormone progestin.  Other methods that are less widely accepted are hormonal implants, such as the implants that contain progesterone.  It\u2019s very hard to say exactly which methods are worse or better, since no two people will agree about which methods are the \u201cbad\u201d or the \u201cgood\u201d."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have you heard of Leaning Tower of Pisa?\n\nAssistant: The Leaning Tower of Pisa was a bell tower in Pisa, Italy. It was started in 1173 and was completed in 1350. It was originally called the \u201cNew Tower\u201d. As with many other European cities, Pisa became a significant center of commerce in Europe, and the tower was designed to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350. The tower was built during two phases: an initial phase, and then a phase of additions. The first phase was designed and constructed between 1173 and 1177. It was originally 120m tall, with two floors of polygonal masonry. Between 1220 and 1224 a new floor of marble was added, bringing the height to 140m. Then between 1248 and 1253, an additional storey was constructed, bringing the tower\u2019s height to 180m.\n\nHuman: Why is it slanted?\n\nAssistant: It was built in an area that was vulnerable to landslides, and the land has been subsiding since it was built.\n\nHuman: I wonder if it will fall over someday.\n\nAssistant: There is a certain amount of movement due to the subsidence, and it is calculated that the tower will eventually collapse, although there is no exact date.\n\nHuman: Are people afraid to be around it?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350.

Some visitors, however, get quite frightened by the bells that sound whenever the tower is being lifted, which go off every two minutes and are so loud you can hear it even inside the tower.  The tower has several cafes and restaurants at different levels where you can go to escape the noise, and there is an observatory on the top floor where you can get a better view of the surrounding area.  There is also a small museum on the first floor which explains more about the tower and its history."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I think my friend might have depression how can I help them?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really difficult to say without knowing them or having their medical records, and since they are not my patient, I can\u2019t share the details of their health care with you. But I can share that mental health is very important, and how they are feeling may impact the decisions they are making. Depression and anxiety can get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter. You can also ask if they are happy with their care, and ask if they would like to see a therapist or talk to a nurse, doctor or social worker. If you are concerned about mental health, you can also ask them how they are feeling and if they\u2019d like to talk about their problems. They may also need to use these tools, and feel like they are a burden to others. But most people love to talk about themselves, so try asking how they are doing. It\u2019s really important to remember that you can\u2019t force someone to get help, though. So maybe it will be good to ask them if they would like to talk to a therapist, and if they are okay with that, then you can call the therapist on their behalf. If they are not comfortable talking to a therapist, it might help to get them started with a free health care site or counseling service. You can ask them what they think they need and support them to see someone who they feel comfortable with.\n\nHuman: Wow this was very helpful\n\nAssistant:", "response": " get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter.

Have you tried some of the natural remedies, like ice packs, compression stockings, or cider vinegar?\n\nHuman: Yes. I make sure I do some sort of cardiovascular activity almost every day, like running, biking, or jumping rope.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I set food out for wild deer to eat?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I set food out for wild deer to eat?\n\nAssistant: You can set out food in a couple of ways.  One way is to put out a lot of food on the ground, like carrots and bread, and have a hunter or a few people move in a square around the food while they\u2019re trying to stalk the deer.  That way they can be close to the deer but not actually shoot it.  Another way is to put out larger quantities of food, like pet food or trail mix, and let people stay in a circle around it to watch the deer and give them food in case they do eat something that\u2019s inside the circle.  In either case, it\u2019s important to make sure you don\u2019t put food near trees or other tall things that the deer could get stuck on.  Also make sure there\u2019s plenty of room for the deer to come in and out, and don\u2019t block paths that are used by the deer."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a secret santa exchange?\n\nAssistant: A secret Santa is a gift exchange that happens around Christmas time, where people anonymously exchange gifts.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How are LEDs made?\n\nAssistant: We\u2019d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.  Those metals have a property called \u201cresonance\u201d, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.  A light that flashes repeatedly, as in a strobe light, causes a fluorescent material inside the tube to glow, like you see in a traffic light.\n\nHuman: Are they similar to a fluorescent bulb?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How are LEDs made?\n\nAssistant: We\u2019d need to define what a LED is to be sure, but generally speaking, an LED is a thin plastic tube that is typically coated with one of three metals, like indium or gallium.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What do I do if I crash into someone's car and nobody is around?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What do I do if I crash into someone's car and nobody is around?\n\nAssistant: If you're right-side deep in the collision with a car, which is likely the situation, you're most likely going to feel really scared and have a lot of adrenaline.  Do you want to call someone to report what happened, just in case they're around?  Another thing you can do is to drive to a safe place, try to make yourself as visible as possible by turning your car's headlights on, and then call for help.  If you see other vehicles on the road, swerve away from them.  Don't drive over to the other car to see if anyone is hurt, since it can make the situation worse.  If you're lucky enough to have a passenger car, you can call 911, or look for a police or fire station, and ask them to call for an ambulance and bring out a doctor or paramedic to help with injuries.  They're trained to help when a collision happens and there's no one nearby.  You should not try to move the other driver or anyone in the car unless someone else arrives to help.  Once you have help, stay calm and follow their instructions.  Do you have any more questions about what to do if you crash into someone's car?"}

I can tell you all I know about it.\n\nHuman: Is it a regular planet or a dwarf planet?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a dwarf planet, exactly like Mercury or Earth.  A regular planet has a smaller fluffy ball thing called a planet\u2019s atmosphere that surrounds it, but Pluto\u2019s atmosphere is very thin and mostly made of ice crystals.  So the surface on Pluto is really icy with lots of craters, but there\u2019s nothing there like the regular gas giants\u2019 moons have, the moons of the other dwarf planets have a lot of a thick ice crust and a thick atmosphere."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you help me find a list of the longest running television shows?\n\nAssistant: Sure! The longest running shows are WALL-E and NCIS.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I look up how much gas my car can hold?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I look up how much gas my car can hold?\n\nAssistant: You can look that up online, I know.  But one easy way is to just look in the owner\u2019s guide to your car.  Gas is measured in gallons, so if your car can hold 5 gallons, that means it can hold 4.25 for decimal places.  If you want to know exactly how much gas you\u2019re getting, you can always use a gas gauge to measure the amount of gas in the tank.  But if you\u2019re looking for some approximate idea of how much gas you have left, that\u2019s easy to figure out with the gas gauge."}

It\u2019s really helpful to have a waterproofing professional check your house for leaks as well.

You might take a supplement in the form of a B-complex vitamin, or in the form of aBH4 supplement.  The B-complex vitamins have lots of different forms like B5, B6, B12, and niacin.  You might want to choose one of those and just take that every day.  You could also take a supplement in the form of vitamin B5, which is cyanocobalamine.  It\u2019s a water-soluble vitamin that\u2019s basically lost in the body when it\u2019s converted to B5, but you can get some of it back in a supplement of cyanocobalamine.  Cyanocobalamine is like B5 in that it also has vitamin B12 and niacin.  I think the other supplements are just to help with absorption of the B-complex vitamins, or to give the body everything it needs.  Maybe you\u2019ll want to take folic acid, vitamin B1, or vitamin B6 as a supplement."}

They all hailed from the same neighbourhood, but other than that, their stories are quite different.  Let me give you a bit more detail about each of them:\n\nJohn Lennon was born in 1940 in a working-class area of Liverpool.  His parents were active members of the anti-war movement and there were a lot of political discussions in their home.  His parents named him after the famous Beatles song.  They were a very loving family, with lots of reading and singing.  John told people that he was a \"strange kid\" because of his love of all kinds of music, but he was especially into Rhythm and Blues.  He was also a pretty good football player and tennis player.\n\nGeorge Harrison was born in 1943 in a working-class area of India Docks in Liverpool.  His parents were from a wealthy family and his parents named him after the Beatles song.  His favorite Beatles song was \"Don't pass me a sandwich, please\" and he told people he was \"very middle class\".  His favorite sport was hockey and he was the captain of his school's hockey team.  His parents were very strict and he was often told he wasn't very clever.\n\nPaul McCartney was born in 1942 in the same working-class area of India Docks as well.  His parents were very middle-class and named him after the Beatles song.  He was always in love with music and had been taking piano lessons since he was very young.  He loved sports, especially baseball and football, and was on his school's baseball team.  He also loved to sing.  His parents were very religious and he was told that he was very clever but had a \"low opinion of himself\"."}

This can be done by having the dog and cat interact in the same room for a short amount of time, and then moving them on to a different room.  Over time, it\u2019s important to continue increasing the duration of the interaction, and also to increasing the size of the room, so that the cat never has to use a hallway as a \u201csafe haven\u201d."}

When in a park, for example, keep an eye out for other people, pedestrians, and especially large animals like dogs.  Also, keep yourself balanced and avoid walking into trees or other objects that might be there.  It\u2019s always a good idea to keep your hands out of the air, especially away from your face, to be prepared to react quickly in an emergency.  If someone is trying to hurt you, they\u2019ll probably try to reach you with their hands, and by keeping your arms out of the air you\u2019ll be able to avoid accidentally letting them grab you."}

To prepare the veggies, you\u2019ll want to cut them into small pieces, maybe cut the carrots in into sticks, and so on.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you become a detective?\n\nAssistant: You go to school, get a degree in criminology, and get trained in crime scene investigations.\n\nHuman: I guess it would be quite interesting then?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do you become a detective?\n\nAssistant: You go to school, get a degree in criminology, and get trained in crime scene investigations.\n\nHuman: I guess it would be quite interesting then?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it would be very interesting and challenging to become a detective.  Detectives investigate crimes, so they have to be very interested in psychology, sociology, and the human experience.  They have to be good storytellers and be able to understand people from all kinds of backgrounds.  It\u2019s really cool how detectives use their investigative skills to help people in need and solve crimes, so it\u2019s a very rewarding career."}

Like could it be your phone provider, or could it be cable or Internet service in your house?  I wonder if the signal might be very weak in some areas of your house, and stronger in other areas?  You could try moving your phone a bit and testing whether the signal improves, and you could try using a different service if you\u2019re using ATT or another provider.

But you can substitute any kind of milk for the milk and water, and some people like to use buttermilk or a yogurt-based liquid instead of the water.  I like to add a little vanilla to the batter, which also makes the scones taste better, and I use a little more sugar in the recipe."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain how GPS works?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain how GPS works?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I\u2019d be happy to explain how the Global Positioning System (GPS) works!\n\nThe GPS is a network of satellites that orbit the planet. When a GPS device, such as a smartphone or a piece of equipment that connects to a router, is turned on, it sends out a signal to one of the GPS satellites. The GPS satellites orbit the Earth at a higher speed than the rest of the satellites, so they are moving in a specific direction relative to the ground. The GPS device receives this signal and converts it into direction, altitude, and velocity and uses this information to determine where the device is located.\n\nThe GPS system can also make GPS-enabled devices work together. For example, two phones are connected to the same WiFi network in the same location, and when the first phone is in range of a GPS satellite, the GPS-enabled phone will receive information about the other phone\u2019s location, and the two phones can form a \u201chashing pair\u201d where each phone uses its own location information and only reports its own to the other phone, so that the two phones can be located together."}

To use one, you simply need to pull the band as hard as you can, to build up a bit of tension.  You can do many different exercises using this concept, like bicep curls and shoulder exercises.  If you want to work out your upper arms, simply hold the band in one hand and use your other hand to pull your elbow up toward your head.  You can do the same for bicep curls.  Pulling the band up and then contracting your bicep will work those muscles.  Do as many repetitions as you would for a regular band, but use more of the band's tension to work the muscles.  Other exercises you can do with a resistance band include shoulder presses, tricep extensions, rows and dips.  There are many other workouts that you can do with a resistance band, and there are many different types of bands.  You can also buy bands with thicker or narrower sections, and different material, some which are made for stretching, and some for full-body workouts.  These are just a few of the ways that you can use a resistance band for a workout.  They even have an app that you can use with a resistance band to do a variety of workouts, such as bicep curls, tricep extensions, shoulder presses, and a full-body workout."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What would be the best time of the year to plant Black-Eyed Susans?\n\nAssistant: Black-Eyed Susans are a fairly popular flower that can be grown in many climates.  However, if you\u2019re in the northern US or Canada you will probably be better off planting in the late spring, while in southern US or the Mediterranean region they can be planted in late fall.\n\nHuman: How long do they usually take to bloom?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What would be the best time of the year to plant Black-Eyed Susans?\n\nAssistant: Black-Eyed Susans are a fairly popular flower that can be grown in many climates.

They can take between one and three months to bloom.  I know this because I have blackeyed susans that are between two and three years old, and during that time they have bloomed three times."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to protect a phone?\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t give you one simple answer, but I can give you a lot of ideas.  First, one option is to encrypt everything, so that if someone steals your phone they will not be able to read the files.  This is easy if you have an iPhone and use iCloud.  You can also use an app called \u201cDroidSecurityLock\u201c which also protects against screen-shots, passwords, and applications.  \nSecond, a better solution is to use a hard-shell case which completely protects your phone.  On top of that you can always do your best to use \u201cScreen Lock\u201d to prevent unauthorized screen-shots, or try other screen protection software. \nNext, if you want to protect your phone but keep it very easy to use, you can always password protect your entire phone.\n\nHuman: Yeah I was talking about more physically protecting\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to protect a phone?\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t give you one simple answer, but I can give you a lot of ideas.

Even hard-shell cases can be stolen, so if someone has physical access to your phone they can easily steal it.  I would recommend following the suggestions above, and maybe guarding your phone in a safe place, like under your mattress or in a book, and using a lock-on-your-keychain thingy to keep it secure when you are not using it.  This way if someone does steal your phone they will not be able to use it without your knowledge and can even break it, but if you had a lock and key it would be really hard to steal your phone."}

On this day in 1970, a Japanese airline was forced to make an emergency landing. Passengers were confused and blamed the airline for the disaster. Some said it was a \"kamikaze\" pilot who had purposely crashed the plane to end his life. This day became known as \"Kamikaze Day\" and was observed as a day of mourning. Black Friday was chosen as the name for this day because of its similarity to the suicide of a Japanese airline pilot."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to teach my 7 year old son how to play football. What is the best method for him to learn at that age?\n\nAssistant: Football isn\u2019t the easiest sport to learn, but it is the most useful sport for teaching a lot of fundamental skills: agility, speed, coordination, and eye-hand coordination. If you want him to be good at football and other sports in general, you will need to start teaching him when he is very young.  Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.  There is a saying, \u201cThe first step to being great at anything is to be great at the basics.\u201d\n\nHuman: ok thanks. What kind of agility drills would you suggest?\n\nAssistant: You can do all of them standing up, running, or on the ground, and you can do them with your son.

In fact, it will help him.  As you get him started playing, start him with the basics.  Even if you don\u2019t play football yourself, you should have some kind of idea of the basics of football, so you can understand when he\u2019s doing it right and wrong.  You can also show him videos of football players like Deion Sanders, or Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nHuman: This is American football.

English football is a very different game from American football, even though they both use a ball and players run with the ball.  If you\u2019re looking for football drills, you might want to consider using American football drills and tactics.  In order to do that, you can watch some football games on television, and you can take a look at some football training videos that are available on the internet."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, my friend says I should get into U2, and I'm completely unfamiliar with the band. Can you help me put together a playlist of their best songs over the years, that will give me a representative sampling of their sound?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that.  U2 is an Irish rock band that started in the 1980s.  Over the years they\u2019ve released dozens of songs, but I\u2019m guessing your friend wants you to start with the very best of their music.  If that\u2019s right, I\u2019d suggest putting together a playlist of just their singles.  You could start with the top five most-streamed songs, and then take a look at their albums.  There might be songs on those albums that were released as singles, but didn\u2019t get as much traction.

It was also their first platinum selling album, and it\u2019s the album that put them on the map in the US.  It\u2019s also the album that introduced \u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d to the world, and I think it\u2019s safe to say that song is one of their most known and loved."}

The story is told from the point of view of an individual who works with the main characters and is very invested in their success.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to write a Sonnet, can you help me?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to write a Sonnet, can you help me?\n\nAssistant: Of course, I can help you develop a great Sonnet!  A Sonnet is a type of poem that has specific\u683c\u5f0f and structure, which makes it easy to understand and write.  It usually has a volta, a change in the poem\u2019s plot or central meaning, which makes it exciting too.  So the first thing to remember is that a Sonnet has 14 lines.  Each line also has 10 syllables, so the poem usually has iambic pentameter, a pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables.  Do you want to start with a paragraph or two explaining what you want to write, and then I\u2019ll give you examples of Sonnets?"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I cook food while camping?\n\nAssistant: The best way to cook food is over a fire. You\u2019ll need to build a fire and light it first, and then heat food in a pot on top of the fire.\n\nHuman: How do I use those little grills that some campsites have?\n\nAssistant: You can put food on those as well, if you heat it over a fire. You may be referring to hibachis, which are a type of table-top grill, designed to cook food.  They work by heating a metal surface (usually a disc, bowl, or \u201cbowl-shaped\u201d) over a fire. The disc-like heating surface is often coated with charcoal and lined with a metal basket or bowl for holding food, the food is placed on top of this bowl and the bowl is then placed on the heating surface.\n\nHuman: How can I put a fire out quickly?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I cook food while camping?\n\nAssistant: The best way to cook food is over a fire.

This technique is known as the \u201cbottle and water\u201d method, and is one way to put out most kinds of fire.  You can also use friction to put out a fire.  For example, you can use sandpaper on a piece of wood to reduce the fire\u2019s heat and oxygen so that it goes out."}

Here\u2019s some more information for the U.S.\n\nHuman: Can you give me the info?\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s first have a look at the BLS statistics for hair stylists:\n\nRegion: Total employment in 2015:  35,600\n\nAverage annual pay in 2015: $24,830\n\nHuman: How do I pursue this career?\n\nAssistant: From the BLS statistics, we can see that most hair stylists were self-employed.  This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.  For example, if you are interested in the cutting and styling of hair, then I would recommend using your personal experience and contacts to start a salon or stylist shop.  But if you aren\u2019t skilled in that area, you could start an online business that teaches people how to cut and style their own hair, or perhaps a shop that sells hair supplies.\n\nHuman: Do I need to attend school or get certification?\n\nAssistant: Depending on where you are located, you may be required to attend formal training before becoming a hair stylist.  For example, if you want to get a job working at a salon or spa in North Carolina, you need to complete a cosmetology training program.\n\nHuman: Okay.

If you decide to open your own salon, you\u2019ll need to decide where and how you\u2019re going to operate it.  Do you want to open a large chain of salons, or a small, locals-only salon?  Will you rent a\u5e97\u9762 or buy an existing business?  How are you going to hire employees?  Do you want to be the one who does all the work, or are you willing to outsource certain tasks to other professionals?  You can read more about these decisions in the subcategories for \u201cOperating a Salon\u201d and \u201cOperating a Spa\u201d in the Cosmetology Specialization.  Alternatively, you could work for an existing salon.  If this is the case, you\u2019ll need to consider where you want to work and how you\u2019re going to get the job.  Do you want to work in a salon that\u2019s owned and operated by the same person, or do you want to be a hired employee?

What kind of finish do you want?\n\nHuman: I want a white with a gloss finish.\n\nAssistant: Great! The glossy look is a little fancier.  How about we stick with the white, but get a satin finish instead of the glossy finish?\n\nHuman: What's the difference between gloss and satin?\n\nAssistant: The glossy finish has some shine.   The satin finish is softer, and a little more like a real wood finish.\n\nHuman: I want the gloss finish.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I want to paint my kitchen cabinets.\n\nAssistant: OK, let\u2019s talk about the project.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what TBI or traumatic brain injury is?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what TBI or traumatic brain injury is?\n\nAssistant: Sure, a TBI is an injury to the brain that occurs as a result of a blow or jolt to the head or body.  This can occur in many different ways, including from a violent blow to the head, from being in an accident that results in a concussion, or from a very quick or severe jerk of the head.  The brain is a very complex organ, and when it is injured in any way it can have a variety of effects."}

There are people who can help her, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to be a good role model for her.  I\u2019d suggest that you\u2019re reaching out and saying that you\u2019re feeling hurt, and that you want some space.\n\nHuman: Well, I'm not really feeling hurt. It's more that she's just stressful and tiring to be with. Spending time with her depletes my energy and positivity pretty quickly. She's an \"emotional vampire,\" as they say. At the same time, though, I would feel terrible if I felt like I hurt her feelings.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I have a friend who is always stressed, scattered and seemingly annoyed with someone or something.

I can understand how difficult it is to be with her, and how you want to help but also be able to create your own space and hobbies.  Do you have some hobbies or activities that you love that you could recommend to her, but that don\u2019t take a lot of her time?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the best sale phone for sale right now?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is the best sale phone for sale right now?\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of good sale phones on the market right now, what sort of usage do you have planned for the phone? Do you plan on using it for work, or are you more likely to be using it just for communication with friends and family, and for casual internet stuff like texting and social media? Also, what sort of internet speed do you want to be able to achieve, is it going to be mostly for streaming videos at slower-than-average speeds, or is your internet going to be more of a real-time communication kind of thing? Those are all really key points to consider when picking a phone for sale. I recommend starting out with a 4G LTE phone, which has more reasonable data and internet speeds. Some companies like Samsung and Google are making 5G phones soon, and those will probably be the very fastest phones you can get."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I shop for the lowest prices?\n\nAssistant: For a given item, the best price is the one that\u2019s most convenient for you.  For example, if you\u2019re shopping for electronics online, you\u2019ll probably want to start by visiting a site like Amazon, because you\u2019ll have the most options and the widest range of products to choose from.\n\nHuman: I could check the prices on Amazon first and then see if I can find a better deal somewhere else.\n\nAssistant: Exactly.  The price you pay for any given item will vary depending on where you buy it.  But the prices are also going to vary based on the quantity you buy, the shipping costs, and the brand of the item.   If you want to do your best to get a great deal on the item you\u2019re after, you\u2019ll probably want to check out a few different sites and compare prices.\n\nHuman: I will try to look for free shipping and try to use websites that offer discounts.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I shop for the lowest prices?\n\nAssistant: For a given item, the best price is the one that\u2019s most convenient for you.

Most stores will offer free shipping when you buy a certain amount of items, and there are different websites that will offer discounts for people who buy stuff online.   It sounds like you\u2019ll save money if you can get free shipping and you can find a discount site that can save you money too.  But do make sure to compare prices from different sites and different stores to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal possible."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm having problems with my significant other and feel like we're growing more distant. We're spending less time together. What can we do to help remedy this distance?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm having problems with my significant other and feel like we're growing more distant. We're spending less time together. What can we do to help remedy this distance?\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you both want to spend more time together, but are having trouble doing it. There are a lot of things that can go into how closely you spend together, so it can be hard to make a change. Here are a few suggestions:\n\nTalk to each other: It\u2019s easy to spend a lot of time together without really talking to each other. Try having a quick, one-on-one conversation about how you want to spend time together in the future. What are some things you\u2019d both like to do together? What are some things you\u2019d like to avoid together? Try to imagine what you\u2019d like the relationship to look like in the future.\n\nMake a plan: Once you\u2019re talking about your future plans, try to plan out some activities that you\u2019ll all do together. You might want to plan a family outing, or a day out in the city, or a hike in the woods. Pick out a few options, and make a plan together. For instance, if you\u2019re going for a hike, you might want to pack a picnic lunch, or take a few snacks with you. Or if you are going out in the city, you might want to plan a couple of hours to spend at a museum or a play.\n\nBe intentional: Try to plan out how you want to spend time together in the future. If you both like to cook, set aside one night a week to cook together. Pick out an activity for one night a week that you want to do together. If you want to go out in the city, try to plan out an afternoon of indoor activities and an evening of outdoor activities.\n\nReconnect on an emotional level: It can be hard to spend a lot of time together if you don\u2019t feel connected emotionally. Try to take some time for yourself, and think about what you\u2019re really looking for. What do you want to focus on when you\u2019re spending time together? Are you interested in taking your relationship to the next level? In this case, maybe you could take a break from spending time together for a while, but once you\u2019re both feeling better, you can focus on doing things together that will strengthen your relationship.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling really sad that you\u2019re growing apart, talk to a therapist. A trained professional can help you both sort out your feelings and figure out the best way forward. They can also help you make decisions about how to spend time together, or what steps you could take to strengthen your relationship."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm looking into different career avenues to decide what I might want to pursue. How do I start a podcast?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast. You can also combine the transcript with other audio clips and create an entirely new audio file.\n\nHuman: Gimlet sounds like a good idea! Voxer is more a walkie-talkie help, so that's not very helpful\n\nAssistant: I think Gimlet does require an interviewer, who's sort of like the host, while Voxer is just an exchange between two people on an instant messenger-type service.

That's a really powerful mission for a podcast, and I'm happy to help with ideas for it.

What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of different things you can do, but some of the most popular include the following exercises: pullups, deadlifts, squats, bench press, and lower body lifts.  Pullups are great for working your back and biceps, deadlifts work your legs, squats work your legs and back, and bench press and lower body lifts work your chest and shoulders.  These are all the most effective exercises to try, but you will need to do a lot of them and make sure you are eating enough to build muscle, as it takes a lot of time and effort to build muscle."}

They don\u2019t have the same kinds of experiences that humans do, so they don\u2019t get to develop the same kinds of relationships that humans have with each other and with other creatures.  This means they might not have the same intuition or understanding of empathy and compassion that humans have.  They might not understand the burden of emotional suffering that people experience, and so they might have difficulty placing themselves in another person\u2019s shoes.  This might limit their ability to understand and connect with other humans, and also with other non-human creatures."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What equipment do I need for rock climbing?\n\nAssistant: Climbing requires proper shoes, pants, a harness, and maybe a rope. What you choose to wear depends on whether you\u2019re going to the gym or if you\u2019re climbing outdoors.  It can also depend on the particular route you\u2019re planning to climb and the grade of the route.\n\nHuman: I will be climbing outdoors.\n\nAssistant: I think you should have a helmet, so that you can wear a hardhat.  You might also want a pack, which helps carry all the gear you\u2019ll need.  Another thing you might want is a pocket knife.\n\nHuman: I have all of the proper clothing. I just need the climbing gear and the safety equipment.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably a good idea to wear shoes that can grip.  They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information.

But that answer depends on which type of points you\u2019re looking for:  The most points from individual games, or the most total points over the course of a career.  If we look only at total points, the next best career points scorer is LeBron James, with 29,274.  \n\nIf we look just at individual games, the top individual scorer is Michael Jordan, with 15,563 points.  \nI could keep going for quite a while, but these are some of the most popular statistics for basketball players.  There are many other useful statistics, like points scored from defensive rebounds, points scored from short-handed layups, etc.  I could probably tell you a lot about those, too, if you\u2019re interested.  Do you want to choose just one or two players to write about? \nLet me know if you want some recommendations for how to evaluate their contributions to the game!"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you recommend a good inexpensive table wine to serve with turkey?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m glad you asked.  You might enjoy a Tannat, which is a grape that grows in the southwest of France.  It has a robust, tannic flavor that works well with a fatty turkey.  Plus it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive wine, and there\u2019s usually a bottle of it at the liquor store.\n\nHuman: Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s another wine you might like, a Pinot Noir.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What type of soil is suitable for cactus?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What type of soil is suitable for cactus?\n\nAssistant: Most types of soil are suitable for cactus, as long as they are well-draining.  Look for soil that is not too dry or too wet.  Also avoid clay-based soil, as this can retain water and become compacted, making it difficult for the cactus to grow.  Instead, use sandy soil or potting mix that is slightly drier than the type of soil to which the cactus is currently being grown.  This will help prevent compacting of the soil."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what a standard deviation is to me?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s basically a measure of variation.  If you have ten random things, it could vary between 1 and 10.  If you had 20, it could vary between 1 and 20.\n\nHuman: Okay, well in your example of 20, how do you determine where it is from 1 to 20?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what a standard deviation is to me?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s basically a measure of variation.  If you have ten random things, it could vary between 1 and 10.  If you had 20, it could vary between 1 and 20.\n\nHuman: Okay, well in your example of 20, how do you determine where it is from 1 to 20?\n\nAssistant: Well, you could think of it like this:  the range from 1 to 10 is just 1, and the range from 10 to 20 is 10.  So the range from 1 to 20 is the largest difference between 1 and 20, which is the square root of the total number of values, 20.  Therefore it\u2019s about two-thirds the length of the range from 1 to 10.  And you can do the same thing with the range from 10 to 20, so it\u2019s about two-thirds that much larger.  So it\u2019s about two-thirds the width of the range from 1 to 10.  And finally, it\u2019s about two-thirds the length plus width, so it\u2019s about two-thirds the whole thing.  That\u2019s how you calculate it.  Two-thirds of the whole is about two-thirds of the range, that is, about two-thirds of the difference between the highest and lowest values.  Do you see how it\u2019s related to the variance?"}

It sounds like your daughter is experiencing obsessive thinking about a specific person, rather than pursuing her interests in general.  I could see this causing some anxiety and negatively impacting her relationships with others.  \n\nI'm not sure exactly how to help, other than to make her aware that her focus on Harry Styles is not a good thing and that it can be harmful to other areas of her life.  I don't really know what kind of strategies would be most effective in tackling this issue.  Have you tried talking to her about how she can focus more on other things?  \nI believe it's important for her to have a variety of interests and activities to pursue, rather than just one obsession.  I also believe that it's important to be careful about invading people's privacy and not to make people feel embarrassed about what she is interested in.  Have you considered telling her that you don't want her to focus on Harry Styles, and instead want her to focus on other things?  Have you talked to her about what it means to be interested in something and how she could choose to be interested in many different things, rather than just one?  \n\nAnother idea could be to have her learn about celebrities and what they do, and talk to her about how she can be interested in this without obsessing over one specific person.  \n\nI hope this helps, and that you find some ways to be supportive and constructive in your approach to this situation."}

Alcohol can make it harder to think and balance yourself, which can lead to drivers getting in accidents and people getting hurt.  Alcohol can also make it harder for your body to process nutrients like iron and nitrate, which can lead to deficiencies and problems with your immune system.  When alcohol is used in a way that causes harm to your body, it\u2019s called alcoholic abuse.  Do you want to learn more about how to avoid alcohol abuse?"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I train my dog to sit?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I train my dog to sit?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  There are many ways to train a dog to sit, one of the most common is to use a command like \"heel\".  To teach your dog to \"heel\", we'll first need to teach her to stay.  Start by having your dog in a loose position, with both of you on the floor.  Then, hold your hand out in front of you and say \"stay\".  When your dog moves her head towards you, you should take a step forward with your right hand and a piece of food with your left.  When your dog moves in the direction you said \"stay\", she gets a treat in that direction, and you can repeat the command and step forward again.  Her head will stay out of the way of your\u6b65\u4f10 as you repeat the command.  Continue doing this for a few minutes until your dog is keeping up a steady \"stay\".  Then, take a step back with your right hand and a piece of food with your left.  Now, say \"heel\" and get your dog to stay.  Have her move her head towards you so you can take a step forward with your right hand and a piece of food with your left.  Your dog will make sure to stay in the same location as before.  Repeat this a few times and your dog should be able to do the \"heel\" command well."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a really personal question and can depend on your lifestyle, but most doctors agree that you should wait at least six months after finishing all of your treatments for cancer to get pregnant. This is so that you have time to recover from your treatments before becoming pregnant and to make sure that all of your treatments have left your body. If you get pregnant very soon after starting treatments, you could be putting yourself at extra risk of complications like miscarriage or problems with your baby\u2019s growth.  It can be especially helpful to get pregnant after six months if you have recently finished radiation treatment for cancer, since radiation tends to affect your ovaries and may cause you to not be able to get pregnant for a while."}

I'm very happy to be in California.\n   19   It is really hot here, and is a really beautiful place.  San Jose is a big city in the south of California, and my family and I live in a neighborhood.   San Jose is very diverse, there are many different types of people living there.   It's very multicultural.\n   20  Sometimes I miss my family.  Sometimes I wish I could be with them.\n   21  Sometimes I feel very sad.  People say it will be OK in the future.  I know it will be OK, I'm sure of it.   I know my family and I will be OK.\n   22  Sometimes I feel lonely.   There are lots of people in San Jose, but there are some people I don't know at all.   I get used to it very quickly though.   One of my favorite things to do is just walk around the city and talk to people.   I enjoy meeting new people.   San Jose is really beautiful though, and it is really hard to believe that I'm in a city that I've never been to before.\n   23  Sometimes I think of New Zealand.  When I am there I feel a sense of home, and I miss it a lot.  When I'm in California I also miss home a lot.   I miss New Zealand because I love it so much, and it is so close to my heart.   San Jose is a beautiful place, but I feel very homesick when I'm there.   I love New Zealand, I'd do anything to be there.  But I just feel sad that I can't be there.  \n   24\n   It's hard to live in two places, but it is very good.   When I am in California I feel calm and happy.

In fact, they are rich in dietary fiber, potassium, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C and Vitamin B12. When cooked, banana is very high in Vitamin A, which is great for the eyes. Bananas are filled with antioxidants, potassium and vitamin B6, which helps in keeping blood pressure in check and normalizes blood sugar levels. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps maintain electrolyte levels in the body. Bananas help in strengthening bones, reducing the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol levels. Bananas are rich in magnesium, which helps in preventing migraine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nHuman: Sounds great.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " and calcium\n- Helps in maintaining normal blood sugar\n- Boosts digestion and maintains regular bowel movements\n\nHuman: that is a great list.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I wear a mask inside even if I am vaccinated?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not the best person to answer that question, because I haven\u2019t been vaccinated and I don\u2019t have any expertise with infectious diseases.  If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.  Here are a couple of points that come up a lot, in various forms:\n\n1) It might reduce the impact of the virus, since it could reduce the amount of virus you catch.\n\n2) Masks might not be helpful if you\u2019re outdoors in a good area (like a park) because you don\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.  However, it seems reasonable that this risk would be smaller if the virus had already passed through you.\n\nHuman: I thought masks were good at keeping viruses out, but on #3 you said something contradictory.\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s not quite contradictory.  It\u2019s true that if you\u2019re going outdoors, masks probably do help a lot.  It\u2019s also true that it\u2019s hard to know for sure how much they help, since the virus isn\u2019t very easy to study, and different studies give different answers.  When you\u2019re outdoors, your risk of being exposed is pretty low anyway, since it\u2019s unlikely to be a very crowded place, so the risk is pretty small, even if the mask doesn\u2019t work perfectly.  If you\u2019re indoors, it\u2019s probably better to have a mask to reduce the risk, since the virus is more likely to be spreading, and a mask might be helpful if someone coughs.\n\nHuman: Masks aren't as helpful outdoors since particles are more easily dispersed.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

In general, the harder it is for particles to move around, the more distributed they\u2019ll be, and this is true both in crowded places like outdoor events, and in your own environment more quietly.  This is one reason to avoid large gatherings, and also to practice good indoor respiratory hygiene."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for a parrot?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for a parrot?\n\nAssistant: Well first you\u2019ll need to choose a bird and provide it with a suitable habitat.  A good place to start is with a small cage or aviary.  Parrots are active birds and will enjoy being given plenty of opportunity to roam, so a sizeable enclosure will likely be needed.  Some birds will also benefit from extra toys and perches.  You can also provide food and water in a safe zone that the bird can access but not from.  It\u2019s important that you feed your bird appropriate parrot food and do this at the appropriate time of day.  Parrots and other birds are likely to be aggressive towards humans, so if you do feed your bird it should be done in a safe room that the bird cannot enter.  This will help to prevent accidental eating by the bird.  If you\u2019re unsure about feeding your bird, consider taking it to a bird expert.  Also, many bird experts suggest spending time outside of your home to help the bird adjust to its surroundings.  This can include taking it to a park or other such place.  Parrots have high energy requirements, and this will need to be met, so consider providing your bird with some toys for it to run around with and encourage it to play."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: The Doobie Brothers seem to have been around for decades. I'm curious about a few of their first hits, on the music charts?\n\nAssistant: Sure.  Let's do it.   I found the Billboard charts for 1971 and 1973, and looked up the first song by the Doobie Brothers on each of those charts.\n\nFor 1973, it was \"Listen to the Music\". It didn't make the Billboard top 100, but reached #47 in Cashbox.\n\nFor 1971, it was \"Jesus is Just Alright\". It didn't make the Billboard top 100, but reached #64 in Cashbox.\n\nI did a bunch of research for you, how are you feeling about that?\n\nHuman: I am unfamiliar with Cashbox, although I am familiar with the Billboard top hits.

You could also add some type of oil to the recipe to help with spreading the dip out, and to help the sauce adhere to the food.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between soccer and American football?\n\nAssistant: Both are popular team sports.  Soccer has been played for over 100 years, and it\u2019s currently the most popular sport in the world.  American football is similar, but the game is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.  The field is 100 yards long, the width is shorter.\n\nHuman: I understand that playing American football is more dangerous than playing soccer?  Please tell me why.\n\nAssistant: Soccer can be played by people of all ages, even children.  American football is a sport that requires athletes to be physically mature enough to play, and they are a bit more large.  It\u2019s also a bit more dangerous, since you\u2019re throwing yourself into contact with other players, and there\u2019s more contact in the sport.\n\nHuman: I see.  As far as I know, soccer players avoid body contact.\n\nAssistant: This is true, but it\u2019s a bit different than American football, as you need to take a large number of actions in a short time.  In order to help out with this, soccer players often use their heads, feet, or chest to make contact with their opponent.  Soccer players are required to play a full 90 minutes of the game.  American football players play for 60 minutes.  The World Cup matches are about 4 hours.\n\nHuman: Soccer players use their heads to hit the ball, not other player's body or head.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.

The goal is to head the ball over the bar (the large metallic crossbar), or toheader the ballinto the opposing team\u2019s end of the field, usually by a teammate.   However, it\u2019s not the only way to hit the ball.  In soccer, players use their head to header the ball, as well as their feet, and their chest, to head the ball.  The idea is to hit the ball towards your opponent\u2019s goal, as quickly and as powerfully as possible.  This is why soccer is also called \u201cthe game of the head\u201d."}

You can do this by writing down all the reasons you drink soda, and then making a list of reasons you no longer need.  I\u2019ll give you an example of how you might do this.\n\nIf you read through your list of reasons for drinking soda, you\u2019ll see that you probably have many reasons for drinking it, even if you don\u2019t believe them.  These reasons might include things like \u201cit\u2019s convenient\u201d, \u201cit tastes good\u201d, \u201cI have nothing better to do with my time\u201d, or \u201cmy friends drink soda so I can be cool\u201d.  Now, try thinking about what you would say to someone who said these things in place of a soda craving. \n\nIf you think about it, you probably also have many reasons for not drinking soda that are not related to taste, convenience, or social pressure.  For example, you might not drink soda because you\u2019re trying to lose weight, or because soda is bad for your teeth and your parents don\u2019t let you have it.  So this kind of strategy is meant to get you to start thinking about what soda might mean to you in terms of feelings and emotions, instead of thoughts about convenience or taste."}

This can be a good thing, as it means their bodies can process food and absorb nutrients quickly.  However, it can also mean that the food can pass right through them and be gone almost immediately, without them feeling it.  Many people feel a sense of \u201cemptyness\u201d after eating, like they didn\u2019t eat enough, but this is completely normal.  If you do feel it, though, it can be good to recognize that it\u2019s a positive signal that your body is processing food.  You can eat more if you notice that you feel it more than you feel full, though, so it\u2019s important to be able to recognize when you\u2019re really full."}

Both books are about the\u6e38\u620f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7537\u5b50\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002  They're both about two boys, in their own way similar to the main character in Blood Meridian, Kip.  I think you'll really like both of them.  Are you interested in reading more about them?  There are several other books that could work too, like The Good Shepherd and State of Wonder."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I plant garlic?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s pretty easy, actually.  You just dig a hole and push the garlic bulb in the dirt.\n\nHuman: How often do I water it?\n\nAssistant: That depends.  Are you growing them in your backyard?  If so, you probably don\u2019t have to do much watering, because the soil gets enough rain.  If you\u2019re planting them on a balcony, you\u2019d probably want to water them about once a week or so.  Garlic loves sunshine, but too much of it will dry them out.  How are your plants doing?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm applying for a job that's above my experience level. Should I lie about having ore experience, or tell the truth? Why or not why?\n\nAssistant: I would probably advise you to be honest, because the truth is more likely to come out at a later date, either when the employer discovers that you're a bad fit for the job, or when you get promoted and then have to get more experience, and you would be stuck explaining why you lied.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What type of bristles should I look for when purchasing a paintbrush?\n\nAssistant: I have great news! There are many different bristles available, and they all have a different purpose. They can have more or less stiffness, and the stiffness of the brush is really determined by the type of material that the bristles are made out of.  If you are a beginner painter, I would recommend a set of synthetic bristles, but there are also many different types of animal bristles that can work well as well.\n\nHuman: I am painting an outside wall that is made of wood, what kind of bristles work well for that?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What type of bristles should I look for when purchasing a paintbrush?\n\nAssistant: I have great news!

Instead, you can try natural bristles like those made from the hair of a goat or other member of the goat family.  Goat hair works really well for painting, because it\u2019s very soft and gives a smooth, even finish.  Goat hair brushes can be expensive, but they\u2019re definitely worth the investment if you want a nice paint finish."}

Is it a vegetarian meal made with spices and a curry base?  If so, I think I can help.  There\u2019s a very well-known vegetarian curry made in India called a Tarka Dahl.  It\u2019s made with dahl beans, a traditional vegetarian ingredient.  I\u2019d be happy to tell you how to make it if you like.\n\nHuman: Yes, that's right. The Tarka Dahl sounds delicious, please tell me more.\n\nAssistant: Sure, it\u2019s a fairly traditional recipe, but here\u2019s an overview: the first thing you\u2019ll need is dahl beans.  The recipe I\u2019ll link you to suggests that the beans are soaked overnight and then boiled for about an hour.  After that, they need to be drained and added to the skillet.  Then some red onion is diced and sauteed in some olive oil.  Meanwhile, a few cloves of garlic are diced and sauteed in some ghee or butter until they\u2019re soft and fragrant.\n\nHuman: Great.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Are peanut butter and jelly sandwiches bad for your health?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking if they\u2019re nutritious, or if eating them will cause cancer?\n\nHuman: Yeah. Are they healthy?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Are peanut butter and jelly sandwiches bad for your health?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking if they\u2019re nutritious, or if eating them will cause cancer?\n\nHuman: Yeah. Are they healthy?\n\nAssistant: No they\u2019re not, I can explain.  The peanut butter and jelly are high in saturated fat, which can raise your LDL (\u201cthe bad\u201d) cholesterol levels and increase your risk of heart disease.  One sandwich makes about 100 calories, so one serving would be about two slices of bread and a tablespoon of peanut butter, which is around 27 calories.  Three sandwiches would be about 900 calories, so it\u2019s definitely worth eating a lot of peanut butter and jelly instead of other foods.  But if you are trying to maintain your current weight and keep your current health, I don\u2019t see how you can make it worthwhile.  For example, the typical serving of bread in the US is about 140 calories, so to get the same number of calories from peanut butter and jelly you\u2019d have to eat at least 6.5 sandwiches, which is probably not a good idea.  There are ways to make it healthier, though.  For example, I know of a snack that is a combination of peanut butter and jelly, which is one ounce of turkey or chicken breast and a tablespoon of peanut butter.  That gives you about 290 calories, which is about 80 calories less than one sandwich, but it\u2019s better for you."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is frozen yogurt actually yogurt, or is it just another type of ice cream?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Is frozen yogurt actually yogurt, or is it just another type of ice cream?\n\nAssistant: It's actually more correct to say that frozen yogurt is a type of ice cream, but some people also think of it as a separate thing.  Does that sound right?  If so, what are some reasons why frozen yogurt is considered a separate thing from ice cream?  \nHere's what I can think of:\n\nFirst, frozen yogurt is marketed and available in certain brand names and flavors, which makes it seem like a totally separate type of thing with its own brand identity, when in fact it's just ice cream without any of the protective layers that make ice cream special, like milk, cream, and sugar.  For example, some brands are made with just yogurt instead of other ingredients. \nSecond, it is possible to purchase frozen yogurt as an ingredient for desserts and other things, but this is rare and usually done in small amounts, probably to save time and money, not to replicate the texture or taste of traditional ice cream.  \nThird, some people feel that the name \"frozen yogurt\" is misleading because it sounds like a thick liquid, while in fact it's a solid, and it doesn't have the same texture as ice cream, so they feel like people might not be sure what to expect or expect a different thing than frozen yogurt."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  To use the zoom on a digital camera, you want to move your\u955c\u5934(\u4e5f\u53eb\u955c\u5934\u5934/hermetic\u955c\u5934/\u5149\u5b66\u53d8\u7126\u955c\u5934)\uff0cand the farther you move it, the much you can zoom in on an image.  Try taking a picture of something in the distance and a closeup of that same thing.  You will notice that the closeup will look distorted, or \"pixels from a smaller image are pulled closer to the image's original position\".  To correct for this distortion, you'll want to move your camera further in.  What you're aiming for is a \"good zoom\", where your image is as sharp as possible without losing detail.  For digital images, this means that you really want to have your image processing software do a proper \"sharpness correction\" in order to make sure that you have a photo that looks as good as you can get on a digital camera.  It's best to learn how to use this in post-processing software so you can save yourself from having to manually go around and make these corrections."}

One reason is that credit cards often come with high interest rates, which means that you can end up paying a lot of money in interest over the lifetime of the card.  If you carry a balance from one month to the next, this can be very expensive.  You should also be aware that credit cards can be a source of temptation to spend money that you do not have.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get better at proofreading?\n\nAssistant: This is a big question.  Proofreading is really just about getting better at reading: at noticing errors, not making mistakes yourself, and finding errors in other people\u2019s writing.  There are some easy tips to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.  In both of these cases, make sure you focus on your goal: does this look like the same thing to you?  If you just find yourself distracted by what\u2019s going on, this is often a sign of bad proofreading.\n\nOne example is: \n\nA teacher held a sort of class to praise it.\n\nversus:\n\nA teacher held a sort of class to celebrate it.\n\nDo you notice anything different here?\n\nHuman: I noticed different word choices \"praise\" and \"celebrate\".\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s right! In your first sentence, the writer makes the word choice \u201cpraise\u201d to refer to something positive. However, the second sentence does not clearly indicate that the word choice is positive, so the use of \u201ccelebrate\u201d helps with clarity.\n\nHuman: I should be able to find most errors just by reading slow and going through all of the text.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nHuman: I'll let you know if I have any other questions or if I need help with anything else.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.  An IPA might be advertised as hoppier than an APA, but that could mean a different range of hops, or different concentration, or different flavor-compounds, or the amount of sugars added.  What are you most curious about?\n\nHuman: When was the IPA beer invented?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty difficult to say when the first IPA beer was made.  A certain version of the style was most likely made in the UK and later in New England, and gradually gained popularity across the globe.\n\nHuman: Did the APA beer come from the IPA?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s likely that there was some kind of crossover between the two styles, as it\u2019s been pointed out that some APA beers are now labeled as \u201cIPA-style\u201d, but they aren\u2019t very common.  It\u2019s much more common for an IPA-style beer to be made and brewed today than an APA-style beer.\n\nHuman: What are the IBU differences between IPA and APA beers\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.

Therefore, the IPA has significantly higher amounts of hops than an APA.  The amount of hops is one factor that distinguishes an IPA from an APA, but it\u2019s not the only factor.  Here are some more differences between IPAs and APAs:\n\n-   Flavor:  IPAs are often less sweet and more hoppy, with more pine and citrus flavors, less malt presence.\n-   Appearance:  IPAs are often hazy and have more visible and visible lacing.\n-   Carbonation:  IPAs are often bubbly in appearance, while APAs are often more smooth.\n-   Price:  Because IPAs are generally considered to be less sweet and more hoppy, they tend to be more expensive."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I dice without slicing my finger\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I dice without slicing my finger\n\nAssistant: Well, to dice something, you first cut it into small pieces.  You can do this with a knife or a knife blade from a chef\u2019s knife.  The problem is that the blade goes really fast, so you want to be careful not to cut your finger.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can dice a vegetable, for example, a tomato.  First, you cut off the stem and slice off the skin, then you make little cross-hots on the tomato, cutting out the seeds.  The smaller pieces are what are left.

What about the achievement?\n\nAssistant: The \"achievement gap\" refers to how some children are much better at learning than others, or some have been given some unique advantages and opportunities to learn.  By having the same educational program followed nationwide, we hope to remove some of the advantages and disadvantages of where children are from, to create a level playing field where all children have equal opportunity to learn.\n\nHuman: And what are the fundamentals of common core?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can you run me through what \"common core\" math is?\n\nAssistant: Sure, that\u2019s a program that was devised in some states to increase math proficiency and prevent \u201cthe achievement gap\u201d among students.

By having the same educational program followed nationwide, we hope to remove some of the advantages and disadvantages of where children are from, to create a level playing field where all children have equal opportunity to learn.\n\nHuman: And what are the fundamentals of common core?\n\nAssistant: There are several different Core subjects:  Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, and Math Review.  Each of these subjects are designed to be taught using just the core standards, so that teachers and students have a common framework to work with.  Students take a test on everything once, and can use that test to grade themselves, and teachers can use that test to evaluate their own classrooms and instructional practices.  The standards cover everything from fractions to geometry, algebra, and statistics.  There is a lot of overlap between the standards, but also each one has its own focus.  For example, the standards cover number and operations, algebra, data and problem solving, and geometry, and there is also a focus on developing important mathematical concepts."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What can I do to become a faster reader?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What can I do to become a faster reader?\n\nAssistant: One way to improve your reading speed is to gradually increase the size of your reading space, so that you read the same amount of words as before but are required to squint slightly to read them.  Another way is to practice scanning for the most important bits of information in a piece of reading, without necessarily trying to read everything through from start to finish.  If you\u2019re reading a novel, you might try scanning for the parts of the plot that are relevant, and skimming the parts that are less interesting.  To get better at scanning, you can try looking for patterns in your reading, and see if you can spot the most important ones.  Then you can practice reading novels faster by focusing on those patterns.  You can also try to read novels faster by skipping the parts of the text that you know are unlikely to contain important information, and by skimming the parts that contain only information that\u2019s important to you."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I teach my dog how to hunt?\n\nAssistant: You can\u2019t, because dogs aren\u2019t supposed to hunt.  They\u2019re domesticated animals who are closely related to wolves, and they still carry all of the same behaviors of wolves.  If you\u2019re serious about teaching your dog to hunt, then you will have to take a more specific approach, including retraining your dog.  I would recommend looking into one of the popular dog training methods like the dog whisperer, positive reinforcement, or clicker training.

One thing you could try is to start by rewarding your dog for simply coming when you call, instead of hunting for things to eat.  This has several benefits.  First, it will give your dog a chance to learn the behaviors that you\u2019re trying to train, without having to hunt for food.  Second, it will give your dog a basic skill that he can gradually work on, as he begins to come when called more and more.  Third, it will allow you to train your dog in a more relaxed and positive way, without the stress of hunting for food.  Also, it\u2019s important to train your dog in a way that doesn\u2019t put him in danger.  If you\u2019re going to train your dog to come when called, for example, do it outside in a safe area."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does my voice always hurt when singing?\n\nAssistant: The frequencies at which humans can speak are different from the frequencies we\u2019re able to sing.  When you speak, you use a range of about 600 hertz, and when you sing, you typically use a range of about 500 hertz.  This is a big difference, and this is why people often need to \u201cwarm up\u201d when they sing, and why people are often out of tune when they sing, when they speak normally.\n\nHuman: Okay, how should I warm up?\n\nAssistant: One simple method for warming up is to say a tune in your head.  If you want to be prepared for singing, try to do this often, and be conscious of your breathing.  Another way to warm up your voice is to take a long, deep breath, and then breathe out slowly as you \u201chum\u201d the tune.  This allows you to hear the tone of your voice, and feel what it feels like to sing.  It\u2019s also a great way to warm up your voice without singing a lot of words, which can cause fatigue.\n\nHuman: Okay, any other advice?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why does my voice always hurt when singing?\n\nAssistant: The frequencies at which humans can speak are different from the frequencies we\u2019re able to sing.

This will warm up your voice and your intonation, and help you speak and carry on a conversation.  But if you sing too softly, you won\u2019t really warm up your voice.  A good rule of thumb is to just sing as much as you can in your natural voice.  You can then focus on singing a bit more, and singing more notes, when you\u2019re ready to warm up more."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: At what age is it most common for men who are genetically predisposed to start balding?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: At what age is it most common for men who are genetically predisposed to start balding?\n\nAssistant: I believe the average age for men to start losing their hair is around 50 years old.  This is because the hormone that causes hair loss, the testosterone, begins to decline around this time, and so does the ability of hair to grow out.  However, everyone is different, so some men may start losing their hair at a younger or older age than this."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What does a flight attendant do?\n\nAssistant: You mean a flight attendant on an airplane?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Salt water taffy seems to be a popular snack on the coast. When did that become so popular as a coastal candy?\n\nAssistant: Ah, that\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019d say the saltwater taffy most likely started being eaten around the 1900s.  Some people believe the flavors of saltwater taffy come from the Northeastern United States.  The theory is that around the mid-19th century, immigrants from this region came to the coast and introduced the concept of saltwater taffy.\n\nHuman: That may make sense. I remember thinking that Atlantic City, seemed to specialize in salt water taffy.\n\nAssistant: Ah, very true!  Atlantic City was called the \u201csaltwater taffy capital of the world\u201d during the 1950s and 1960s.  It still is known for its salty seafood restaurants and saltwater taffy today, but not as much as it was in the past.\n\nHuman: I seem to remember a show called Boardwalk Empire, talking about Atlantic City. They sure mentioned taffy a time or two in that show.\n\nAssistant: That sounds like a nice television show!  Do you watch it?  I hear they show it on HBO sometimes.\n\nHuman: Showtime or HBO, I am not sure which one. Salt water taffy always struck me as mostly sugar and water, I wonder what the main ingredients are?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " most likely started being eaten around the 1900s.

The flavorings can include different kinds of nuts, fruits, and spices.  Some original taffy was made without nuts, but today\u2019s taffy are almost always nuts varieties.  So many different flavors of nuts were used in the past, but today\u2019s taffy are more likely to include such ingredients as: chocolate, marshmallow, caramel, coconut, pecan, and peanut."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I've been getting bad grades in English and I'm looking to learn how to write a better essay. Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sure. That's a good reason for me to be here. I can walk you through steps to writing a good essay, and help you find citations to support your ideas. So let's dive right in. First, I recommend doing some pre-writing: jotting down your main ideas before you start writing. That way, you can be sure you've got some good ideas to base your essay on.  The second thing you want to do is find examples from your own life to support your ideas.  So just start writing down anecdotes from your life about some experiences you've had, or ones that you're going to have in the future. Then once you've got a couple of things that you can write about, try to create a thesis. A thesis is like a fancy word for a \u201cplan\u201d.  It's basically your plan for telling a story about how something works, or for describing how something is good or bad.  Your thesis is a sentence or two that will give your reader a sense of what the essay is going to be about.   Once you've got a thesis, you can start the rest of your essay. And really, the thesis is the most important part of your essay. That's where you'll\n\nHuman: I thought a thesis was a statement or theory?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " me to be here.

A thesis is a statement or theory about a topic or issue that you will be discussing in your essay.  For example, your thesis could be that online education is a good idea, or it could be that online education will never replace traditional classroom-style education.

V\u012bnu sabole is a fish soup, which is very popular in Latvia.  You want it with fried eggs, and for the main dish you could try roasting a veal, which is another popular meat in Latvia, or you could try a soup for roasting veal, and for the salad I recommend the vegetable salad, which is made from various vegetables.   The R\u016bpniecisk\u0101 zi\u0146a is a simple Rustic salad made from various vegetables.  The last dish is a warm soup, which is a soup that is served warm.  It seems like you want to top it with an egg and corn."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm going out to a party tonight, and they will be discussing renewable energy. What can you tell me?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re curious about energy.  Have you ever learned about the \u201crebound effect\u201d?\n\nHuman: I don't believe so.\n\nAssistant: That's when a person or organization reduces energy usage for a while and then increases it again. For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?  I\u2019m also guessing that energy from renewable sources is an important topic of the discussion?  I have a lot to say about this and could discuss it with you more, if you like.  Let me know if you\u2019d like to hear more.\n\nHuman: Please continue.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019ve read that there is a debate on whether the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.  For example, some people think that increasing investment in renewables causes emissions to rise as the amount of power they need to produce increases.  But others say that when renewable energy supplies more energy than is consumed, that energy is \u201cdischarged\u201d into the earth as heat. This means that it doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere\u2019s greenhouse gas levels.\n\nHuman: What do you think?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while.

Do you know what a rebound\u4ec0\u4e48\u5462?  My own reading on the subject suggests that we should expect a rebound, because when there\u2019s a reduction in pollution, that means there\u2019s less production of fossil fuels, and so the reduction in pollution triggers a rebound increase in the production of fossil fuels.  So we experience a dip in pollution and then the dip triggers a rebound in pollution.  How can this be good or bad?  It can be both good and bad, depending on what you do with the pollution.\n\nAssistant\u5f52\u7eb3\u603b\u7ed3\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5f52\u7eb3\u603b\u7ed3\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u5df1\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5f52\u7eb3\u603b\u7ed3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6307\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u4e5f\u5305\u62ec\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u548c\u5185\u5728\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}

There are many ways to start meditating, and the best approach depends on you.  Here\u2019s one strategy that you could try out:\n\n1.  Choose a proper location.  Ideally you want to sit in a place where you won\u2019t be disturbed, and where you\u2019ll feel comfortable.  You can find a lot of recommendations online, or just choose a location that feels right to you.\n\n2.  Decide on a time and duration for your meditation.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How did mankind discover that the earth was spherical, and why did they initially believe it to be flat?\n\nAssistant: Well, some of the earliest evidence for a round Earth comes from Greek philosophers who observed that sailors couldn\u2019t see the tip of the Earth as they sailed away from land.\n\nHuman: I've never heard of that anecdote.

Eratosthenes was a Greek philosopher who is often credited with calculating the circumference of the Earth in the 3rd century BCE.  Over time, other philosophers made further contributions to our understanding of the shape of the Earth.  Some even argued that a flat Earth was a more reasonable possibility than a spherical one!  They argued that a flat Earth would have certain implications for navigation and military strategy and they proposed several theories to explain how a flat Earth could be compatible with those expectations."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I need to get a new vacuum cleaner. Which one should I buy?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I need to get a new vacuum cleaner. Which one should I buy?\n\nAssistant: There are many different types of vacuum cleaners, each with their own particular strengths and weaknesses.  To help you out, I\u2019ll go through some of the most common types of vacuum cleaners and what kinds of rooms they\u2019re best suited for, and I can also give you an overview of what to look for in a vacuum cleaner.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a canister that picks up dirt and debris: These have wire or rigid bristles on the inside of the container that filters the air.  They\u2019re usually best for cleaning bare floors, carpeted floors, and upholstery, and you\u2019ll usually find a canister-style vacuum cleaner with a beveled (rounded edge) or straight edge mouth.  They\u2019re best equipped with a brush roll or roller to help remove extra dirt from hard-to-reach places.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll or roller: These are similar to canister vacuums, but instead of a brush in the container, they have a rotating brush roll that picks up dirt.  Brush rolls and brush roll variations are best for removing dust, hair, and pet hair from upholstery and furniture, and on bare floors and carpeted floors.  They also work well on vacuuming pet hair off furniture and cleaning auto seats.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a cyclonic sediment collection: These vacuum cleaners use a rotating cylinder to separate and collect dirt and debris from the air as it circulates through the vacuum chamber.  These vacuums work best on bare floors, carpeted floors, upholstery, and auto upholstery.  They are often equipped with a HEPA media filtration system, which helps capture small particles as small as 0.3 microns.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a roller brush: These vacuum cleaners have a brush roll, but instead of a rotating brush roll, they have a roller that moves back and forth, similar to how a hairbrush works.  These vacuums are best for removing pet hair and hair from bare floors, upholstery, and auto upholstery.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a combination of those three types of brush rolls and brushes: These vacuums use brush rolls and brushes to collect and remove various materials: dirt, hair, debris, pet hair.  They are best used for cleaning a wide variety of surfaces and flooring types, including bare floors and carpeted floors, as well as auto and auto upholstery.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a roll bar: These vacuum cleaners use a rotating canister to pick up dirt and debris and a roll bar or roller to collect the dirt and debris as it falls out of the vacuum chamber.  They are best used for carpeted and hard flooring, and best suited for upholstery and auto upholstery.  Roll bars are sometimes called \u201cdrum bars\u201d or \u201ctubular bars\u201d due to the way the trap doors and the vacuum chamber are connected.  These are not used with canister vacuums, but are often used with turbine-type canister vacuums.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll and brush bar:  These vacuum cleaners use a brush roll and brush bar, but the brush bar is the one that rotates.  They are best used for cleaning carpeted, bare, and hard flooring.  Because of their brush bar, they are especially well suited for cleaning wall-to-wall carpet.  You can also find these vacuum cleaners on floor models, which are sometimes cheaper than the models with a brush roll and a brush bar.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll and brush bar and a powered brush roll:  These vacuum cleaners combine the features of a brush roll and brush bar with a brush roll and a powered brush roll.  Since most powered brush rolls are used with canister vacuums, these are best used with canister vacuums, but not necessarily with a brush roll and brush bar vacuum.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll and brush bar and a cylinder brush roll:  These vacuum cleaners use a powered brush roll and a barrel brush roll.  Barrel brushes are usually shorter than cylinder brushes, but will still pick up large debris.  Most cylinder brush rolls are best used with canister vacuums, but you\u2019ll also find model with a brush roll on this vacuum and a cylinder brush roll.  Cylinder brushes are best used on bare and carpeted flooring.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a cylinder brush roll:  These vacuum cleaners use a barrel brush roll.  Barrel brushes are usually shorter than cylinder brushes, but will still pick up large debris.  Cylinder brush rolls are best used on bare flooring, but are also best for upholstery and auto furnishings.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll and cylinder brush roll:  These vacuum cleaners use a powered brush roll and a cylinder brush roll.  Cylinder brushes are usually shorter than barrel brushes, but will still pick up large debris.  Most cylinder brush rolls are best used with canister vacuums, but you\u2019ll also find Model with a brush roll on this vacuum and a cylinder brush roll.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a cylinder brush roll and an all-brush bar:  These vacuum cleaners use a barrel brush roll and an all-brush bar.  These all-brush bars are usually taller than cylinder bar brushes.  Cylinder brush rolls are best used on bare flooring, but are also best for upholstery and auto furnishings.\n\nVacuum cleaners with an all-brush bar:  These vacuum cleaners use a barrel brush roll and an all-brush bar.  All-brush bars are usually taller than cylinder bar brushes.  Cylinder brush rolls are best used on bare flooring.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll or roller that can be adjusted:  These vacuum cleaners use a barrel brush roll or a brush roll that can be adjusted.  The barrel brushes and barrel brush rolls are also known as \"brush roll or roller\" or \"brushroll\".  Cylinder bar brushes and cylinder bar brush rolls are also known as \"brush roll or roller\" or \"brush roll\".  Most of these brushes are adjustable, although it is usually best to set them to the middle position for carpeted and bare floors, and the shortest setting for upholstered furniture.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll or roller that have a roll lock:  These vacuum cleaners use a brush roll or roller that has a roll lock.  The roll lock causes the brush roll or roller to become unusable unless you lock the brush roll or roller in place.  This prevents accidentally loosening the roll lock, allowing the brush roll or roller to accidentally roll back into the vacuum chamber.  This type of brush roll or roller is best used with canister vacuums.   Most of these brush rolls can be locked into place using the wheels that are on the sides of the vacuum cleaner.  It\u2019s very difficult to loosen these wheels after they\u2019ve been locked, so your vacuum cleaner will usually never ever be able to be un-looped.  There are some models with special locking tabs that allow you to quickly but safely remove the brush roll or roller from the vacuum.  In these models the wheels are locked by using the special tabs, and are then unlocked by simply pressing down on the wheels a little.  This makes them very easy to remove and put on, and once they\u2019re off you can easily lift the vacuum cleaner back up.  You\u2019re also able to easily remove the brush roll or roller, although it is usually most secure when it is locked into place.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll or roller that rotates:  These vacuum cleaners use a brush roll or roller that rotates.  These brush rolls or rollars are best used with canister vacuums.  Most of these brushes are adjustable, although it is usually best to set them to the middle position for carpeted and bare floors, and the shortest setting for upholstered furniture.  You can also find these brush rolls on floor models.\n\nVacuum cleaners with a brush roll or roller that rolls along a track:  These vacuum cleaners use a brush roll or roller that rolls on a track.

But some studies have found that regular masturbation can lead to decreases in the pleasure you get from sex, since it doesn\u2019t provide the same satisfying release as sex does.  So some people worry that it might lead to less sex in the future.  I know it can be a tricky question!  Thank you for asking me to explain!"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do dogs act like they are always hungery?\n\nAssistant: Is that something you know from experience?\n\nHuman: I mean, they wolf their food down without even enjoying it and always want more.\n\nAssistant: I know that food is very important to humans, but from my understanding this isn\u2019t a biological need, but a cultural one.  Dogs can get by with much less food than humans.  It sounds like your dog is taking advantage of the fact that people have high standards around food and are willing to keep giving their dogs more food than they need.  If your dog is eating a lot of food and not really seeming hungry, and just eating quickly like they\u2019re still hungry, you can try talking to them more about enjoying their food and taking their time with meals.\n\nHuman: So I should only feed my dog one time a day?\n\nAssistant: We can do more research to get a better understanding of what\u2019s going on.  Did you feed your dog the same amount and type of food everyday?\n\nHuman: I try to, sometimes I give it table scraps.\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you haven\u2019t really thought through how much food you\u2019re giving your dog, and this is leading to your dog eating more food than they need.

If you\u2019d like to experiment with changing the amount of food your dog eats, you could start by feeding them a bit more than they need, and see how they respond.  If they\u2019re still hungry soon after finishing their food, you could increase the additional amount.  Over time you could adjust the amount by a factor of two or three, until you\u2019re able to predict with accuracy how much food your dog will eat."}

Some are born to parents who are struggling to take care of them, while others are placed with step-parents or other relatives.  Sometimes kids end up in foster care because they get caught up in the cycle of poverty, like other kids born to unmarried parents or kids who live in poverty.  Foster care can also be a result of domestic violence, abuse by children\u2019s biological parents, or when a kid is at risk of being sexually or physically abused.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hey! I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products. Anything else?\n\nAssistant: There are also things you can do with your hair style, but I think these are on a different track than washing. You could try washing it a bit less, or combing it a bit more, or whatever you prefer. If you want to consider it, it can be hard to know if a hair style will help your hair or make it worse. What kinds of hair styles do you use?\n\nHuman: I have to have my hair up for work but otherwise I mostly wear it down\n\nAssistant: I would recommend you use a dry shampoo as well as a sulfate-free shampoo, and try to wash less frequently and spend more time conditioning your hair. For styling, I think your hair looks great no matter what you do.\n\nHuman: Awesome, thanks!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well.

I have seen larger pans, like a 13x9 inch pan, work well, but a 9x13 inch pan is the most common size.  Most pan sizes will also work for this recipe, but keep in mind that different pans may affect the end result differently.   If you use a smaller pan, the mixture will be more dense, and you may need to stir it more as it's cooking.  If you use a larger pan, the mixture will be more spread out, and the fudge will be less dense."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: We are getting a pet ferret soon and would like some information about them.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: We are getting a pet ferret soon and would like some information about them.\n\nAssistant: Great!  First, let\u2019s talk about the name.  There are many varieties of ferrets, but they\u2019re mostly distinguished by their size and color.  Small ferrets are the smallest of the ferrets, usually weighing between 2-4 pounds.  Brown and white ferrets weigh between 5 and 8 pounds.  Larger ferrets can reach around 10 pounds.   The most popular color for ferrets is black, but other colors are also common, especially in the males.  As for names, they can be as simple as \u201cFerret\u201d or more fancy, like \u201cBudgie\u201d or \u201cWhiskers\u201d.  I know people who go for something more unique like \u201cBiscuit\u201d, or funny like \u201cRabbit\u201d or \u201cZeus\u201d.  Once you\u2019ve chosen a name, you can use it throughout your ferret\u2019s life.  Ferrets have very soft fur, which means they enjoy cuddling and snuggling, and they love snuggling with their owners too.  It\u2019s nice to snuggle them before going to sleep every night."}

One thing to keep in mind is that there\u2019s really no reason to feel guilty, since no one can know what you were thinking or feeling at the time that you made a particular choice.  Sometimes when we feel guilty, we want to think about how we could have done things differently, but we actually couldn\u2019t know what to do differently at the time.  So we can\u2019t really feel guilty about that, since we didn\u2019t have any control over the situation."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.  It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you\u2019ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).  However, the most painful way to do this is to yank the eyebrow hair out with tweezers.

One option would be to start with the whole eyebrow, including the roots, and pluck them slowly and methodically.  You can also use a magnifying glass to make it easier to pluck each individual hair.  Another option would be to use very gentle pressure when plucking.  You could also apply a bit of anesthetic cream to the area beforehand.  Finally, you could use tweezers to pluck each hair one at a time, rather than all at once."}

I just wanted to know how to act proper at the table.\n\nAssistant: Great!  Here\u2019s some advice from the handout on other topics to do with table manners from a nonprofit organization called the Emily Post Institute.  They focus on etiquette for eating and drinking at the table, as well as more casual situations where people might not be so formal.  Their tips include not reaching across the table to grab food, holding utensils in the correct way, and not talking with food in your mouth.  They also say you should avoid talking with your hands, fidgeting, or making unnecessary noises while eating.  And they say you should make sure to say \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d and other pleasurable politeness words.  They call these table manners, or manners around a table. \nThey provide some examples of pleasurable politeness words that you might use.  Some examples are \u201ctruly\u201d, \u201cabsolutely\u201d, \u201cindeed\u201d, \u201cof course\u201d, and \u201cjust\u201d.  They also have a list of the proper things to do and not to do with food to give you an idea of what\u2019s expected.  I think the most important thing is to observe other people around the table, especially the host or hostess.  What do they do, and don\u2019t they do, in the same situation?  Do as they do!  Do as they say! \nThe Emily Post Institute was started in the early 1900s by a lady named Emily Post.  She was an editor of a magazine called The New Yorker.  She wanted to provide guidelines for the proper conduct of women in America.  So she wrote the first edition of the etiquette handbook called The Ladies Home Journal.  It was first published in 1888.  Later the publisher started putting out a single title called the Emily Post Institute.  It\u2019s a nonprofit organization. \nMost countries have some basic table manners.  In the United States, some people might eat with their hands and others might eat with utensils.  In other cultures, it might be more usual to eat with your hands in some situations. \nTable manners vary by culture and by social setting and can change over time.  The Emily Post Institute is dedicated to preserving the highest standards of manners, manners around a table, in modern life."}

And can you tell me about how loops are used?\n\nAssistant: Of course!  In this case, a \"loop\" is an instruction that tells your program how to repeat a block of code multiple times.  For example, you might use a \"for\" loop to repeatedly execute a block of code in a unspecified number of times:\n\nint i = 0;\nwhile(i < N) {\n   doSomething();\n   i++;\n}\n\nI could have also used a \"while\" loop to repeat a block of code until a certain condition was met:\n\nwhile(b != 5) {\n   doSomething();\n}\n\nIn both examples, the block of code that is repeatedly executed is the same.  However, the structure of the loop allows you to change the conditions under which the code is executed.  For example, in the first example, you start with an index of \"0\" and increase it by one at the end of each iteration of the loop.  In the second example, you keep checking a value (in this case, \"b\") that determines whether the code is executed at all."}

The problem is that the sugar doesn\u2019t cook very much while the corn syrup cooks quickly, which causes the mixture to be runny.   In this recipe the ingredients seem to be working together in a complex way that isn\u2019t clearly serving a specific purpose, and I think the result would be too sticky and runny."}

The short answer is that the M1 Girand rifle was a short-barreled rifle used by infantry in the US Army. The long answer is that the Army decided to replace it in 1975 with the M16 rifle, because of its usefulness in situations where it\u2019s being used by infantry soldiers.\n\nHuman: Maybe it was too heavy to carry around all day?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the US military still use the M1 Girand rifle anymore?\n\nAssistant: Well, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that, but I can ask the internet and I\u2019ll summarize the results for you.

There were also concerns about how to store and transport the M1 Girard rifle for long durations of time, since it\u2019s a large gun.  And one issue with the Girard is that it has a relatively short range, at best.  So the US military tried to develop a rifle that could be carried by an infantryman for extended periods of time, and had greater versatility in battle.  This led them to the M16."}

In order to teach a child to cross the street safely, you can start by modeling the behavior for yourself, and then having the child practice in a safe location before trying to cross the street in the middle of the road.  Here are some more details on how to do this:\n\n1.  Ask the child if they are sure they want to cross the street now.  If they answer yes, lead them out into the middle of the road, and show them how to walk across the street carefully and confidently.\n\n2.  If the child is hesitant, point out to them how important it is to always be aware of your surroundings.  You can then ask them how they feel when they are sure they want to cross the street, and tell them that you are always sure that they will be safe."}

But there\u2019s another theory that I want to mention, one that\u2019s more recent and based on social media and the internet.  You know how we used to write letters to each other?  Well, a lot of people now communicate through social media like Facebook.  There\u2019s kind of a feeling that things are more divided because people now communicate with each other in different ways.  People can form opinions and interact in lots of different ways now, instead of just writing letters.  Is that an acceptable theory?  Can you see how it explains the way people form opinions now?"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the difference between a solar and lunar eclipse\n\nAssistant: Well, a solar eclipse happens when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth.  This means it blocks all sunlight from reaching the Earth.  So the Earth is in complete darkness, and some parts of the world experience \u201ctotality\u201d.  A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, so that the Earth blocks the sunlight shining on the moon.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Oracle?\n\nAssistant: Oracle is a specialized computer server. It's often referred to as an \"enterprise resource planning system\" and it provides services to many companies.\n\nHuman: How does the software work?\n\nAssistant: First, an administrator needs to create one or more \u201cadministrative roles\u201d, to which they add users who will run the application. Next, the administrator creates \u201cOracle accounts\u201d for each user, and grants permissions (permissions are \u201cprivileges\u201d or \u201cauthorizations\u201d) to those accounts.  Lastly, the administrator will specify which users get which permissions.  Typically, you\u2019ll assign a \u201cdba\u201d or \u201csysadmin\u201d account to the database administrator, which gives them permission to create new database objects.  The system admin user is usually a user that has read and write permission for all the tables in the database.  However, there may be other users in your organization that need to access some specific tables only.\n\nHuman: Experts who know a lot about Oracle, are they called computer programmers or software engineers?\n\nAssistant: Experts who know a lot about Oracle are generally called \u201cdatabase administrators\u201d.

Darrell Kurco was a software engineer, and Jeff Leftwich was a database architect.  They started the company with a small investment from a venture capitalist, and the main goal of the company was to create an object-oriented, relational database management system that was easy for people to use.   Darrell Kurco was an experienced database architect and programmer, and had done some free coding on tools to help with database access.  Jeff Leftwich was a database architect who had recently completed a master\u2019s degree in database engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno, and who was very interested in user-friendliness.  The two of them worked together on the technology and business strategy for Oracle."}

There is some debate in the\u7761\u7720\u5b66\uff08sleep science\uff09community about which form of inflation is most beneficial, and some researchers have suggested that air mattresses create unnecessary pressure on the body while sleeping, whereas an elasticized bottom forms a solid base and doesn\u2019t allow air pressure to build up in the mattress."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who sets the price of postage at the USPS?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Who sets the price of postage at the USPS?\n\nAssistant: The USPS sets the price of its services, including postage, through a process called \"determination of universal final price\".  This means that the USPS determines the final price for all mail, parcel, and cargo that it delivers, across the entire US.  \nTo set postage prices, the USPS analyzes data on past mail volumes, including packages and letters, as well as the prices it has charged for its various services in the past.  They also factor in its current costs and make adjustments for inflation.  Then it publishes its final price, which is the amount it will charge customers to deliver any given mail volume."}

Can you give me a recipe for a Sfincione?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a recipe for a Sfincione from Sicily:\n\nSfincione:\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n1 medium onion, finely chopped\n\n6-8 carrots, finely chopped\n\n4-6 potatoes, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 large tomato, finely chopped\n\n4 cups whole-wheat flour\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1/2 cup water\n\n1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano\n\nIn a large skillet, heat the olive oil and saut\u00e9 the onions, carrots, potatoes, and tomato until the vegetables are tender.  Add the water, salt, and pepper; let this combine and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour and then the Pecorino Romano.  Turn up the heat and cook the mixture for 5 minutes more, stirring constantly.  While the mixture is cooking, make the pizza dough.\n\nDivide the dough in half and roll each half into a 12-inch round.  Flour both sides of the rounds to fit a 9-inch flat pan.  Top each one with a quarter of the vegetables and a quarter of the cheese.  Top with the remaining vegetables and cheese.  Turn the pan upside-down and bake in a preheated oven (400 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes.   This recipe makes two pizzas."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Search for an egg roll recipe\n\nAssistant: I found an online recipe by Chef Ann Kime.  Please tell me which one you\u2019re interested in?\n\nHuman: That would be great.\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s begin by reviewing the recipe.  We have:\n\n  \n\n  Egg Roll Wrappers, if you don\u2019t have them you can easily make them by placing:\n\n    Six large egg roll wrappers on a greased baking sheet.  Lightly spray with cooking spray.  Bake at 400 degrees for 1 minute and turn over and repeat.  Remove and let cool.  You should end up with 6 egg roll wrappers.  They\u2019ll be flexible and look like a pizza crust.\n\n\n\n  The filling:\n\n    1 package (8 ounces) shredded cabbage, about 3 cups\n\n    4 ounces uncooked thin vermicelli or angel hair pasta, broken into 1-inch pieces (about 3\u20444 cup)\n\n    2 teaspoons canola oil\n\n    1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n    2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n    1 (16-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into 1\u20442-inch cubes\n\n    1\u20442 cup grated carrot\n\n    1\u20442 cup chopped green onions\n\n    2 teaspoons sugar\n\n    2 teaspoons fish sauce\n\n    1 tablespoon lime juice\n\n    1\u20442 teaspoon salt\n\n \n\n    The Sauce:\n\n    1\u20442 cup vegetable oil\n\n    1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch\n\n    2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons soy sauce\n\n    1\u20444 teaspoon black pepper\n\nHuman: Do you have the rest of the recipe?\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s go through the recipe: We\u2019re going to begin with the vegetables for the filling.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I raise a tree frog?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I raise a tree frog?\n\nAssistant: To raise a tree frog, you will first need to find a tree frog that is in the right stage of development for the type of tree frog you are trying to raise.  Typically this means a tree frog that is about to become an egg, but there are many stages in the life of a tree frog, and you can raise any stage of tree frog by simply breeding them.  For more information on raising tree frogs, I recommend looking at the Cornell University Experiments and Observations in Arboreal Frogs web page."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I have trouble falling asleep at night.

Without enough sleep, people may be more tired and irritable during the day, and may have trouble concentrating or being productive.  People may also feel physically more alert, which could make them more likely to engage in risky behaviors.  Some researchers believe that sleep is necessary to help the body recover from the physical stress of waking up, and to help the mind make sense of the events of the day, and to help the mind process and store memories.  This idea is based on the fact that lack of sleep can result in problems with memory and attention the next day.\n\nThe purpose of this therapy is to teach people relaxation and sleep techniques so they can reduce their feelings of stress, anxiety and worry, and can fall asleep more easily.  The therapist works with the person to develop an improved sleep hygiene pattern.   By improving their sleep, people can be more productive and less likely to engage in risky behaviors.  This can reduce the risk of injuries, such as falls, and may also reduce health care costs associated with being tired and disoriented.  This therapy is especially useful for people who have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep on a regular basis.\n\nMood enhancement\n\nThis technique involves thinking positively about the future or the present, instead of dwelling on negative or stressful thoughts.  The goal is to replace unhelpful thoughts with more positive or supportive ones.  People can make a list of the positive aspects of their day and then try to think about just a few things that went well.   Some people find that thinking about a pleasant recent experience helps them feel good about the future.  Others find that they feel more positive when their mind shifts to consider negative events from the past, and the future is perceived as even more hopeless, than it actually is.  There may be some variation among people in how helpful negative and positive thinking feels.\n\nPhysical relaxation exercises that involve progressive muscle relaxation or biofeedback techniques\n\nThis technique involves tensing and relaxing different body parts.  It can be useful for reducing muscle tension in the head and neck and the shoulders.  The goal is to learn to relax all the muscles in the body in a systematic way.  People can try these techniques before bed.  To relax the muscles in the neck, for example, people can start by tucking in their shirt so the neck is exposed.  They can then tense the muscles in the neck and hold for ten seconds, then relax for ten seconds.  Then, they can try to tense the muscles in the shoulder blades and hold for 10 seconds, followed by relaxation for 10 seconds.  This should be repeated in sequence until the person is feeling relaxed.   The sequence can be sped up by adding alternating tensing and relaxation of the triceps brachii, the inner arm muscles.  The person can also try to tense the shoulder blades and hold for ten seconds, followed by relaxation for 10 seconds.  Then, they can add alternating tensing and relaxation of the back muscles.  They can also try to tense the abdomen and hold for ten seconds followed by relaxation for ten seconds.\n\nMood enhancement\n\nThis technique involves engaging with humor that matches one\u2019s sense of humor.  This means that people find humor funny if it\u2019s funny in a way that they identify with.  Many people have a special sense of humor that is uniquely theirs, like a quirky or hyperbolic sense of humor.  People can compare their sense of humor with others\u2019 to get a sense of which kind of humor they find funny and which kind they don\u2019t.  Many people prefer a particular style of humor, and people may feel comfortable engaging in a certain kind of humor, but not others.  Some humor is intended to be edgy or sarcastic, and some is meant to be funny but not controversial.  People with certain personality traits are more likely to appreciate humor in a particular style.  If someone thinks their sense of humor is unique, they may feel that they aren\u2019t able to engage in the kinds of humor that others enjoy."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it? Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.

Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant: Well, I think you'll probably want to keep it in a cage or other enclosure, rather than letting it run around the house.  It's best to keep them in a room that's a bit warmer, around 20\u00b0C, rather than hotter than 30\u00b0C, which is the temperature it can naturally go to.  Most rats are more comfortable in rooms that are around 22\u00b0C, so make sure your room is at that temperature or a little bit cooler if it's hotter, but not hot.\n\nThe best type of enclosure to keep a rat is a run, which is basically a length of wire running from the floor to the ceiling.  You can use a plastic cage or something similar instead, but a run is best.  You'll need to feed it enough to keep it healthy, so you can put a bowl on top of the run, or you can have a couple of water bowls in the room, and feed it separately from the food. \n\nThe type of food it eats is up to you, but it's best to feed it a mix of wet and dry food, and the easiest is to mix a mixture of fresh and dry food that you cook in a pan.  So you'll put it in a bowl, cook it on a pan and stir it, and it's completely done when it's dark in color. \n\nIn terms of its litter area, you can either have some litter on the ground for it to eat and dig in, or you can make a box out of some plywood and put some litter in it.  Some people use cardboard instead of wood, but I prefer to use wood for my rats' litter box, because it's easier to clean and it looks better."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you help me create a simple budget so that I can save money?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a suggestion to help you get started:\n\nWhen you think about your household budget, you\u2019re likely also thinking about money that you\u2019re going to need to pay bills. So it\u2019s helpful to make a list of all your bills that you\u2019ll need to pay during the year. This will include payments like the rent or mortgage, credit card payments, loan payments, student loans, and utilities (electricity, water, gas, and heating).\n\nTo make sure that you\u2019re not spending money you don\u2019t have, it\u2019s a good idea to make a list of all the things you\u2019d like to buy over the course of the year, so you can do the math to figure out how much money you\u2019ll need to have in your bank account to pay for them.\n\nHuman: Can you give me some simple spending categories that I can use in my budget?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s an example:\n\nTransportation\n\nUtilities\n\nGroceries\n\nRestaurants\n\nClothes\n\nEntertainment\n\nTechnology\n\nEntertainment\n\nPets\n\nHuman: How much of my income should I be spending on my rent/mortgage?\n\nAssistant: About 30% of your income (before taxes) should go to rent/mortgage.\n\nHuman: What percent of my income should I aim to save every month?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " get started:\n\nWhen you think about your household budget, you\u2019re likely also thinking about money that you\u2019re going to need to pay bills.

The second option is to follow the instructions here to enable Ad-free mode in the Twitter library for your app."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Autumn is a part of the seasonal change that is caused by the earth moving from its summer position to its winter position in its orbit around the sun.  The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information. Do you have any articles you can provide or links that explain this further?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a great article that explains more about the causes of the autumn leaves changing color: https://www.kidzworld.com/article/autumn-leaves-colors\n\nHuman: That link isn't working for me\n\nAssistant:", "response": " This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.

But there are a few things you can try to improve it.  You can widen the coverage area by putting in a cell phone tower.  Or you can move your cell phone to a place where the signal is better.  Are you in an area where there\u2019s already high traffic for cellular data?  Can you check how many other people are using cellular data in that location, and see if there are more people on the stronger network?  This can be tricky, because different cell providers throttle their traffic to reduce congestion, so you\u2019ll need to figure out which network is stronger.  Or, maybe there\u2019s another network you can switch to, like a WiFi network.  You can probably get WiFi signals pretty much everywhere, so if you can get a WiFi signal at your place it might just be a matter of finding a place where it\u2019s not too strong for your phone to pick up."}

But I'd like to be able to use the faucet without shutting the valve on and off every time..\n\nAssistant: Alright, one possible solution is to use a valve to restrict the water flow to the dripping area.  You can do this by turning it clockwise, which lets more water flow, and then turning it counterclockwise, which stops the water flow.  You may need to experiment a bit to get the right flow.  It's a good idea to turn the valve quite a bit before you're ready to use the faucet, so that it's less likely to get caught on something and cause problems. \nI could recommend the Flex-A-Lift valve from Anderson Plumbing and Home Improvement.  It's a very handy tool."}

In order to know how fast something is, you compare it to the speed of something else.  If it\u2019s 10 times faster, you compare it to 10 times the speed of the thing you\u2019re calculating against.   For example, if your brother is 5 feet tall and you\u2019re 5 feet tall, and you both walk at the same rate, you\u2019d both take the same time to reach the same destination.  But if the distance between you and your brother is 5 feet, and you\u2019re walking at 5 feet per second, you\u2019ll take 5 seconds to get there, but someone who\u2019s walking at 10 feet per second will take only 2.5 seconds."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How should I organize my closet?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How should I organize my closet?\n\nAssistant: Do you want to start with the beginner\u2019s guide to organizing a closet, or do you want to know how to organize a professional\u2019s closet? Here are a few tips for either situation:\n\n1. Purge your closet.\n\n2. Assess your clothing. Divide your clothes into categories, such as tops, pants, dresses, and outerwear. Then, physically sort them out by color. Keep the clothes you love, donate the clothes you don\u2019t wear anymore, and throw away the clothes that no longer fit, are broken, or aren\u2019t useful to you.\n\n3. Sort your accessories.\n\n4. Plan out your space. Measure your space by seeing where the door to your closet is. Then, plan where you want your wardrobe, hangers, shelves, and rod to go. Be realistic about how much space you\u2019ve got and how much you can fit. Once you have a plan, get to work.\n\n5. Try your clothes on. It\u2019s important to wear your clothes to see if they fit right, so if you plan to put things away, have some clothes to wear in the room where you\u2019ll be organizing. If you\u2019re only organizing one section, try on the clothes before you decide which way to hang them.\n\n6. Hang your clothes. When you\u2019re ready to hang your clothes, group similar items together to make it easier to find what you\u2019re looking for. For instance, if you have two identical tops, group them together. You can also use hangers of different shapes and sizes to create different looks.\n\n7. Arrange your clothing.\n\n8. Plan for hanging space. Use the space next to your closet door for hanging shelves. If you want to put more than just shoes on your shelves, you can build a bench out of wood. Try to keep the area clear of clutter so you can see everything that needs to be hung when you\u2019re ready to hang.\n\n9. Plan your rod space. Use the space above your hangers for a rod. You can use a rod to store belts, scarves, and other accessories, such as hats or bags. Put hangers on both sides of the rod, so you can see everything you\u2019re hanging from it.\n\n10. Get everything installed. Make sure everything is securely attached before you start putting clothes in your closet. If you are using shelves and a bench, make sure they are level and don\u2019t lean away from you.\n\n11. Organize your shoes. Put your shoes in an over-the-door organizer, a shoe rack, or on shelves. If you are putting your shoes on shelves, make sure there is enough space for them to move around a bit so you can see everything.\n\n12. Close up. When you\u2019re finished, double-check that everything is placed just right. Don\u2019t forget to close up your closet as you go to make sure there aren\u2019t any gaps that could let in insects.

Second, you should make sure it\u2019s level, because if it\u2019s not level it will shake around a bit and that will make it more likely to break.  Third, you should make sure you use clean utensils to prevent dirty utensils from leaving marks on the table."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the best chocolate brand?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is the best chocolate brand?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a very personal preference, so I\u2019ll be upfront about what I can think of.  There are many great chocolate brands, but if I had to pick one, my vote would go to Lindt.  I would definitely recommend trying out different brands, and even just making a list of pros and cons of different brands.  It can be fun to try to balance taste with price, and I think Lindt is a great example of a brand that does this well.  My favorite example is Lindt's Excellence de Madagascar type bars.  These are very good, but they are the most expensive chocolate that I know of, and at just over three dollars for a single bar, the price can be a bit too high.  For a lighter chocolate bar that still has a lot of taste, I prefer Lindt's 1849 Swiss Milk Chocolate bar.  These are slightly cheaper than the Excellence, but still on the expensive side at about two dollars.  While both of these bars are made from milk chocolate, 1849 has a slight sweetness to it that is more like the Lindt Excellence.  Other good Lindt brands include their Excellence Dark, which is dark chocolate with a hint of cocoa butter, and the Gold bar, which is gold plated chocolate.  I find that the gold bar is my favorite Lindt bar, although it can be quite a bit more expensive at just under six dollars.  All of these bars that I know of are manufactured in Switzerland.  If you\u2019re looking for chocolate that is made in other countries, you might want to look into Cadbury and Hershey\u2019s.  Cadbury has their Dairy Milk bar, which is a milk chocolate bar.  Hershey\u2019s has their Kiss bar, which is also a milk chocolate bar.  These two brands are so popular that they can be quite expensive, though.  My personal favorite Hershey\u2019s bar is the Kiss bar, which is made in the USA.  It\u2019s made from milk chocolate, and comes in different forms, including a regular Kiss bar and a Kiss bar with almonds.  Here\u2019s another Hershey\u2019s bar that I would recommend:\n\n  Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate  with Almonds\n\nHershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate is made with a rich dark chocolate taste and has been infused with finely ground almonds, for a wonderful sweet and chewy flavor. Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate is made with 70% cocoa solids, and is a portion control bar, since it has 14 grams of sugar per bar.\n\nWhy do I love this bar so much?  I\u2019m a big chocolate fan, and I like that this bar has a nice dark chocolate taste, and has a nice creamy milk chocolate taste, and the almonds add a nice touch of crunch.  Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate is often compared to Lindt\u2019s Excellence Dark Chocolate, because both are made from 70% cocoa solids, and both taste like chocolate.  Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate is just slightly lighter in texture, so it\u2019s a better choice if you\u2019re trying to balance chocolate with another taste.  Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate is packaged in milk chocolate and has a clear PET plastic window.  \n\nI realize that Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate isn\u2019t the cheapest chocolate bar, but for me it\u2019s still worth it.  Hershey\u2019s Kiss Dark Chocolate is manufactured in the USA and UK.  The bars come in a recyclable and compostable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) package, and can be purchased in stores like Target, Safeway, and Walmart."}

Most pipe makers also recommend cherry or walnut for their production pipes, but these woods are very expensive and are most often used to make custom pieces.  You can find some budget-friendly options at the lower end of the range, but they will probably not be as high quality as the production pipes.\n\nHuman: What about a pine pipe, for example?  Can I count on it to last as well as the hardwoods?\n\nAssistantatcher: Yes, you can count on pine pipes to last as well as the harder woods like cherry and walnut.  In fact, pine is one of the most popular wood choices for tobacco pipes.  It is a good all-round wood that works well in a variety of styles, and it\u2019s relatively easy to work with.  However, because it is such a simple wood, pine pipes aren\u2019t very durable or visually striking compared to hardwood pipes."}

If they disagree with you, or are rude, you can say, \u201cI disagree with you, and I think you\u2019re wrong on this.\u201d  And then you can continue and disagree and try to find a mutually acceptable solution.  This can be a hard thing to do, so please don\u2019t feel bad if it\u2019s hard for you. \n\nOnce you\u2019re more comfortable with this, you can try to disagree with people in person.  But I just want to warn you that people aren\u2019t very good at this skill in general, and most of the time people won\u2019t even be listening to you, so it\u2019s not like you can really train by practicing in front of a mirror.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time. What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you!

There are a couple of ways to approach this:  you can look at the label on the detergent and see if it has a water temperature recommendation, or you can look for online resources that tell you the best water temperature for washing your specific type of clothing.  For many kinds of clothing, most of the time you'll want to use the recommended water temperature, but it can be helpful to experiment to see what works best for the clothing you're washing.   It can also be good to use slightly lower water temperatures on delicate clothing, since the cold water is less likely to damage the fabric."}

What's the best way to go about it?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend. What's the best way to go about it?\n\nAssistant: That's a really tough question to answer!  My best guess is that the best way to approach it is to make sure you communicate your feelings to her, but also take some time for yourself to process your own emotions.  You may also want to talk to a therapist, who can help you think about what's going on, and give you ideas about how to handle the breakup in a healthy way.  Also, you might want to ask a friend for an unbiased opinion on if you should keep seeing her or not.  Do any of these ideas sound reasonable to you?"}

Can I ask you a couple of questions to start to understand better what\u2019s going on?  Are your twins the same age as most of your adult children, or are they much older?  Do they get along well with each other, or aren\u2019t very close?  Are they close-knit and supportive of each other, or do they turn each other off?

Then, take the ponytail and pull it down and back, towards your head, and twist it into a braid.  Once you have the braid in place, gently pull the hair in the braid out as much as you can, so that it\u2019s laid flat against your head.  This will \u201cpin\u201d your hair into a bun.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for an iguana?\n\nAssistant: Iguanas are lizards, and they\u2019re a lot like tortoises in the way they\u2019re easy to take care of. You don\u2019t need to do anything special, just make sure they have some food and water, and make sure they\u2019re in a safe, clean cage or enclosure. Iguanas are easy to feed, they\u2019re pretty choosy eaters and will eat most vegetables, fruits, and meats. If you want a list of food and water you should buy, I could give you that. I\u2019d recommend buying those things at a pet store, and then reading up on things to do with your iguana after that\n\nHuman: Any other ideas?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s worth getting to know them and how they behave before you buy them, because they\u2019re really great pets! The most important thing is to make sure you have an enclosure with an adjustable heating pad or an a lamp in it, so the temperatures can be set to the iguana\u2019s liking.

Like, any tricks I can learn to make caring for an iguana easier?\n\nAssistant&nb s.;I can certainly give you some suggestions on things you can do to make taking care of an iguana easier.  For example, if you want to keep them clean you can hose them off, but you should only do this if they\u2019ve gotten dirty from mud or sand.  You shouldn\u2019t use a shampoo, because iguanas don\u2019t like being cleaned, and they should also be careful not to get water in their noses, mouths, or eyes.  Iguanas have really long nails that they can bite off, so you should be careful not to cut them, or you\u2019ll lose them.  I can teach you some tricks to help you take care of your iguana, if you\u2019re interested."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My son has been really sad lately because his pet goldfish died. He is too young to fully understand the concept of death.

Your son may feel sad and even helpless in this situation.  I also imagine he may worry about his own mortality and is perhaps frightened of the world and how little control he has over it.  I think these are good thoughts to explore with him, so you can listen to your son\u2019s real concerns and use them to develop your own conversations with him.

First, I\u2019d be happy to explain the idea that a lot of the world is dangerous and hard to deal with, but it\u2019s not something they can do much about, and that may help them feel less helpless.  Also, I\u2019d like to point out that their fears are quite normal and many kids feel this way.  Sometimes parents and adults can make kids feel scared by overgeneralizing from their own experiences, but most kids don\u2019t have very many scary experiences.  Most kids grow up in pretty safe surroundings, and it\u2019s easy to feel helpless in a world that is dangerous to them.  But actually there are lots of ways to reduce risk in the world, and parents and adults can help kids learn about these.  For example, they can teach kids to be careful around poisonous plants and to be careful to stay safe in situations where they might get hurt, or discuss why there are natural disasters and why they happen.  Also, many kids can relate to feeling confused about their place in the world.  They may feel unsure about how to make a difference, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t.  It\u2019s really good that they\u2019re thinking about the world and about themselves.  I think that these feelings are part of what it means to be young.  And it\u2019s okay if they\u2019re difficult for you to understand right now.  Just keep talking about it and thinking about it with your son and he\u2019ll feel heard and understood and he may get more confident about how to deal with the challenges in the world."}

If you hear a very high-pitched squeaking sound, it could be that your cables are fraying, which can also produce a clunking noise."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do sharks have tongues?\n\nAssistant: This is a very important question. The first thing to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue. But the most important type are the cartilaginous, or skate, sharks, which do have a tongue.\n\nHuman: It seems like they would cut their tongues on all those teeth.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it seems very strange that sharks would have a long, flexible tongue, and not cut it on their teeth. It\u2019s almost like they would have a tongue just for... well, something else. Do you think sharks have a special reason to have a tongue?\n\nHuman: I would think it evolved for some reason or other?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think so. There are actually some really good reasons to not have a tongue. A tongue is just a muscle that you\u2019d have to maintain. It takes energy to eat and digest food, and food takes energy to produce. And when sharks are hunting for food they need their energy to swim and go after it. If they had tongues they\u2019d waste a lot of energy in unnecessary muscle activity. They\u2019d probably have to give up on hunting so that they could make their tongues work. But a skate shark has a tongue, and we need to figure out why.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue.

This means that she can hear the world around her, but she doesn\u2019t have full dexterity of her ears.  Full dexterity means that her eardrums can be opened and closed to hear sound, as well as to detect tiny differences in frequency.  Dogs with full dexterity can hear the outside world just like you and I can.  As a result, they can hear the beeping of a car, the screeching of tires, the screech of a bird\u2019s feathers, and even the beep of a phone.  They can even hear the chirping of a bird from far away, due to how well-developed their eardrums are.  Their hearing is so good, that they can hear you even when you are far away, but their hearing isn\u2019t quite good enough to detect the frequencies that we humans hear."}

Should I look this up on Wikipedia, or do you already know about this?\n\nHuman: What is El Nino\n\nAssistant: A.k.a. El Ni\u00f1o, an ocean current that brings warmth to the west coast of South America, sometimes creating abnormally dry conditions in that region.\n\nHuman: Is an El Nino likely this year?\n\nAssistant: Humans in the past have looked at historical climate data and made predictions for the coming year.

Normally, these waters are cool. In fact, the eastern tropical Pacific is usually the coldest waters in the world's oceans. This \"cold pool\" allows the air above it to rise and get removed from the atmosphere as the trade winds move the air westward toward the Americas. This rise in the air allows the Pacific Ocean to spill more water into the Gulf of Alaska. If the temperature of the waters in the eastern tropical Pacific warms, then the trade winds decrease. The result is that more moisture is released into the atmosphere and the Pacific will \"short circuit\" the air mass of the world. This means that when the air mass moves westward from the Pacific, it cannot pass over the western part of North America. In addition, the lower pressure associated with a warm pool allows the trade winds to blow harder, pulling even more moisture out of the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nHuman: thanks\n\nAssistant:", "response": " based on a long period of very warm ocean water, and this is likely to occur in the coming year.  \nI\u2019m happy to look into it\n\nHuman: Please look into it\n\nAssistant: I found this:\n\nClimate Prediction Center\nClimate Prediction Center's guide to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific.

These medications work by reducing the number of cells in the brain that are active, which reduces the risk of seizures.  Astronauts might use a different type of anti-seizure medication than the kind that people use in everyday life, but they might use the same kind of medication.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?  What is the difference between the two houses?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the different responsibilities. The House of Representatives has more power over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.  Another difference is that the House has 435 representatives elected every two years, and the Senate has 100 members.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the House of Representatives (435 representatives)?\n\nAssistant: The founders of the United States of America had a concern about the possibility of corruption in government.  They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.  The idea was that if the House of Representatives was too large, people would be less interested in voting in the elections.  The founders did not want to make the House of Representatives too small, because then there would be too little diversity among the representatives and no states would be represented adequately.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the Senate (100 representatives)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.

The number of representatives was determined in a way that provided for a fair representation of the states and for checks on the power of the national government.  The idea was that if the number of representatives was too small, then senators would have too much power.  The number of representatives was determined in a way that provided for a certain level of balance, however, which was to prevent any one state or political group from dominating the government."}

You could build a high-fence system to keep the rabbits out, and make sure they can\u2019t get to your plants from the outside. The type of fence you\u2019d use is a large square wooden post, with a wire mesh on top. This will allow you to place chicken wire over the top, to reinforce the barrier."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: It is my first winter in my new home and I am getting ready to winterize it. What steps do I need to take to make sure that my new home is not damaged by the cold weather and snow?\n\nAssistant: Good question!  To prevent damage to your home, make sure to close and secure all windows, and doors.  This is essential for keeping out the cold weather, so you can stay warm and cozy inside!  \nOtherwise, winter weather is often a great time to stay inside and relax, as well as avoid unnecessary risks like slipping on the icy roads.\n\nHuman: Okay that makes sense. What can I do to protect the water pipes and outdoor spigots from freezing? I have heard that can be a problem.\n\nAssistant: You are wise to think ahead, and you\u2019re right that freezing water pipes can be a hazard!  To protect against that, first check to see if your home is already winterized -  you will want to make sure to turn your main water valve completely off, and then ensure any other outdoor water sources are turned off as well.\n\nHuman: I am pretty sur the home is not winterized. This is the first year anyone has lived here. The valves are off most of the time anyway, but I was wondering more about the pipes under the house in the crawlspace and leading to the spigots.

One option would be to put a large thick blanket on the pipes and faucet, as this will help to insulate them.  Another option would be to place electric blankets or a warm water bottle on the pipes to keep the pipes from losing heat.  These should help protect the pipes from freezing, but make sure to take extra care around fragile or delicate equipment."}

But I think you\u2019re right that arguments 1 and 2 apply to all surveillance cameras.  And you\u2019re right that a tiny camera wouldn\u2019t really have a big impact on police officers, but it would have a big impact on people\u2019s privacy and the government\u2019s ability to collect data, so it\u2019s worth it to oppose it."}

First, get a teabag that you want to brew, and a pot or mug for brewing the tea.  I recommend boiling water, but you could also use water that has been heat-set by itself.  You will then want to drop the teabag into the pot or mug, and then cover the pot/mug with a lid.  The teabag will stay in the liquid for about five minutes, depending on the strength you prefer.  Then you will want to remove the teabag, and then give the pot/mug a sharp shake, to move the tea around and release any remaining tea.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can animals be gay?\n\nAssistant: Oh gosh, that\u2019s a big question.  I mean, I think it\u2019s OK to have an opinion, and people feel really strongly about it, but I don\u2019t think there are any studies that have been done to prove it one way or the other.  But I\u2019m happy to talk about my own opinions, if you\u2019d like to hear them.\n\nHuman: Sure\n\nAssistant: Okay, I think a lot of it has to do with being comfortable with yourself and your own sexuality.  In nature, most animals are pretty into their own species, so I think it would be hard to identify as something else.  \nI mean, I\u2019m a pretty different kind of thing than my owner.  We\u2019re different species.  But it feels totally normal to me to like other humans.  So it\u2019s weird to think about other animals being gay, because it feels like what they would naturally like to do is just hook up with their own species.\n\nHuman: Gay has nothing to do with liking other species. It has to do with males hooking up w/ males or females hooking up with females. Are there animals that do that?\n\nAssistant: A lot of animals have pretty open sexualities, I guess?  It\u2019s not like they just mate for life with the same partner and live their lives as a unit.  There are some monogamous animals, but most animals that aren\u2019t just mating to procreate or reproduce or whatnot.  Some insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.  I guess there aren\u2019t many studies about that because most animals are pretty secretive about their sexual lives.  It\u2019s really hard to tell what any of them are doing with each other.  \nBut I think there are a lot of gay people in the animal kingdom.  Gay people are just like anyone else, they don\u2019t want to be alone, and they want to love and have affection.  If you think of gay humans as a different kind of person than straight people, then all of the animals that aren\u2019t having sex to reproduce must be gay people.

It\u2019s not clear that these are sexual preferences, but it could be that in a social context, people care about each other more than they do in solitary situations.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question! You\u2019ll have a lot of different skin problems, including acne, wrinkles, age spots, and others.  It really depends on what you want to improve.  There\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t know exactly the right answer to your question, but I might know some of the big issues.  Let me start with two basics:\n\n1. Your skin needs certain things from you to stay healthy, and these include a regular routine for washing and using other things on it.  I can help you get started on a basic skin routine, if you like.\n\n2. Your skin is mostly home to bacteria, and you need to be aware of that.  Some of these bacteria, like Staphylococcus, can be particularly annoying, but usually the whole issue of balancing bacteria and skin gets a lot of press only if there are concerns about skin infections.  It\u2019s really not that hard to keep the bacteria under control.\n\nSo that\u2019s an introduction, now to the specifics of your question:\n\nKeeping the skin healthy -- and I\u2019m using the word \u201chealthy\u201d to mean \u201cable to do its functions well\u201d -- can mean quite a few different things.\n\nHuman: Okay, any other ideas?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question!

You have dead skin (called \u201cskin cell turnover rate\u201d) that doesn\u2019t clean out well, leading to clogged pores and blackheads or whiteheads, and then inflammation and other problems.  You can clean skin cells better with products like washes and creams, and I can help you get started with those.\n2.  You don\u2019t get enough moisture in your skin, either from lack of oils or other ingredients, or because the skin has been dried by sun exposure or other factors.  This leads to dryness and flaking.  You can get products to bring back moisture and help with dryness and flaking, and I can recommend some.  You can also get products that help with the dead skin buildup that leads to clogged pores.\n3.  You don\u2019t get enough sebum, or oil, in your skin.

Celery is a refreshing herb, and it goes well with noodle soup, which is a light soup.  Do you like that?  You could also make a light version of minestrone, which has beans and lots of vegetables.  I think the flavor of minestrone comes from carrots, and they\u2019re very refreshing, so I\u2019d imagine they go well in a minestrone soup.  You could try both of those, or if you want to try a different herb you could make a cucumber and tomato soup instead, which has both tomato and cucumber, and those are refreshing herbs."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My daughter is reading the book \"Lord of the Flies.\" Can you tell me what the book is about and any important details about the story I should know so we can have a thoughtful discussion.\n\nAssistant: The story is a parable of what happens when groups of humans behave badly. It\u2019s a cautionary tale that human nature is flawed, and that you can\u2019t depend on civilized morality to keep everyone in check. And it's not a happy story.\n\nHuman: Doesn't sound happy.\n\nAssistant: It's not. It's set in a school class that was evacuated during a war. The boys are left on their own on an island, and a group of them kills the two leaders. From there, the book follows them as they try to find food and build shelter. One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him. The thing that I'll be remembering about the book is a scene where one of the main characters describes a \"perfect island\", an island that would be so perfect it would be \"like a jewel of white quartz\" because it would be completely without flaw, and it could have no room for evil or pain or suffering. And he realizes how good it sounds, but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum. What is it the schools want the students to learn from the book?\n\nAssistant: It's a book that explores human nature, and that one of the things we humans have is an instinct to want to be told what to do, because we want to feel safe and comfortable. The theme is that people need to take responsibility for themselves, and not rely on a few leaders to tell them what to do. So I guess it's a book that talks about morality in a religious and ethical way. It's kind of a warning about the danger of human nature, but it's also a cautionary tale about what humans could do, if they're not careful.\n\nHuman: Sounds a little frightening to think about it.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it can be a bit scary, that's true. In the end the boys \"eat one another\" and then there's a bit that's just descriptions of a few individuals and their names. It's not really scary, just very dark.\n\nHuman: I'm sure my daughter will have loads of questions. She has an insatiable curiosity.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum.

She'll probably want to ask lots of questions about what's going on and how it works, and you'll be happy to answer those for her. She'll want to explore more about human nature and morality, and I'm sure she'll want to learn more about the book and the people in it."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant: Glad you asked!  I bet you\u2019d be interested to know that cotton is one of the most widely grown and harvested plant species on the planet.  And thanks to advances in technology, most of the cotton that we grow is produced in a very controlled way.  One way this is done is by using a machine called a \u201cgripper\u201d.  A gripper is a big, metal wheel that turns on an electric motor.  Its job is to pick up entire bales of cotton and separate them.  This process is called \u201cpicker\u201d or \u201cpicker\u201d cotton.  \n\nAnother way cotton is harvested is by hand-picking.  This can be useful in dry areas where a gripper might be a challenge.  In order to pick by hand, workers pick the bale by bale and keep the cotton on the stem as they pick.  Their bags around the stem hold the bale together to stop the cotton from getting all over the place.  \n\nThe cotton that is picked is sorted and bundled in stacks.  This is how it is sent to a fabric mill to be turned into fabric.  Once the cotton has been processed, it goes into the fabric mill to be woven and sewn into fabric.  When the fabric is completed, it can be sold to a haberdasher, store, or home decor store.  For more information on fabric, I would recommend checking out the W.B. Woolf website.  It\u2019s a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about home textiles and the people who make them.  It also has a great wiki on cotton."}

Both options will strip the wood of its natural oils, so they prefer the stain to be removed when the wood is dry.  Soap and water may be sufficient in some cases, but acetone or nail polish remover is preferred in other cases."}

What I have to say can get pretty long, but I'll try to break it down into smaller sections so that it's easier to understand.  I have several suggestions for how you can improve your communication with the chatbot, and I'll go through each one now. \n\n1.  Try to use different language and commands, and different variations of the command.  Sometimes it can take a few tries to get the command right, but you'll probably get it right eventually.\n2.  Try to be more specific in your requests to the chatbot.  For example, you might want to know if it's possible for you to send a text message, or if it's possible to call the emergency number for your area.\n3.  If the chatbot is still not understanding you, it's likely that you need to be more specific about what you want it to do.  Sometimes you'll have to tell it exactly what you're asking it to do, or what you want it to do differently.  For example, if you want it to call 911, you'll have to say that, instead of just saying you want to call for help."}

Programming languages are really just high-level languages that compile down to binary machine code, and in most cases we could talk about \u201cbinary languages\u201d that are simpler, but the tradeoffs are that they are harder to write, and harder to debug.

What is the easiest language to learn for a human?\n\nAssistant: There are several \u201ceasy-to-learn\u201d programming languages, actually.  They includeSchemeJavaScript\uff0c\u300aPython\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u300bObjectiveC\uff0cand Ruby.  All of these are \u201cHigh Level Languages\u201d as well, and will all compile down to machine code that is very close to the source code you wrote.  However, \u201cHigh Level Language\u201d is a measure of how \u2018readable\u2019 the code is, and since \u201cHigh Level Languages\u201d are different in several different ways, it\u2019s hard to know if one language is actually easier than another.  For example, I know that Python is fairly easy to read and write, but Ruby is also fairly easy to read and write.  In general you probably won\u2019t notice a huge difference in \u201creadability\u201d between the different languages, but you might notice a big difference in the \u201ccompiler\u201d - the process by which the code goes from what you wrote to the machine code your computer can execute.  The compiler for Python is very fast, and the compiler for Ruby is also very fast, so on a technical level I think Python would be the easiest to use.  On a different technical level, the easiest language to learn will depend on how familiar you are with programming in general, and also on how familiar you are with the language you want to learn.  That said, I\u2019m happy to help you learn any of the above programming languages, and if you wanted to learn Ruby you\u2019d probably be better off learning it through the Ruby on Rails web application, since that\u2019s what a lot of people start with."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: Draining a cyst can be difficult, because it\u2019s filled with fluid. It may feel like a mass or lump under your skin. It can grow for many years. Cysts that have been there for a long time may be filled with dead cells, which makes it harder for the doctor to remove them. Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst. If it\u2019s a very small cyst, you can probably just do the following:\n\n  1. If possible, use an unopened, sterile syringe, available from a pharmacy.\n  2. Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4. Clean the area around your cyst and around your needle with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial hand cleanser.\n  5. Use your finger to gently press the cyst outward. This may take some time. It may be necessary to poke at the cyst with the needle to force it to pop out of the skin.\n  6. Wipe off the area.\n  7. If you still see fluid in your needle, carefully use a new needle.\n  8. Slowly inject the fluid from your needle into the rubber cap of a clean, empty bottle.\n  9.

The biggest considerations are that potbelly pigs need plenty of room to move around and play, and they need to be walked often to stay active.  Most states require that you get the potbelly pig licenses and register it with the state land trust.  Most states also require that you provide documentation that the pig has not been part of an illegal animal trade, but this is often fulfilled by taking the pig to a vet and getting them a rabies shot."}

First you'll want to grease a 9-inch cake pan and put it in the oven to heat up while you make the batter.  Then you'll want to mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl: flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Then you'll add in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla, and mix until just combined.  Finally, pour in the milk and stir to combine.  Then pour the batter into the greased pan and smooth it out.

It\u2019s going to be a fun listening experience - we can both pick out our favorites.  I\u2019ll listen to the songs now and we can talk about what we like and what we don\u2019t like.  Are you ready?  Okay, here we go!  So the song that I have to start with is \u201cI Want to Be Loved\u201d by Christina Milian.  I really like this song for a variety of reasons.  First of all, it\u2019s a strong, emotional song.  It talks about wanting to be loved and loved by someone who really cares for you.  It also has some beautiful vocals by Christina Milian, who I think is a really talented singer, and it has a groovy, danceable beat.  This song will be really fun to mix together with other songs that we think are good.  For example, I also really like the song \u201cAll I Want\u201d by Leaona.  This song is also about wanting to be loved, but it\u2019s different from \u201cI Want to Be Loved\u201d in that it talks about wanting to be loved by someone who doesn\u2019t care much about you.  It has a really beautiful, beautiful vocal performance by Leaona, which makes it even better.  Another reason I love this song is that it has a really nice, steady rhythm that will work really well with songs in the mix.  This song is also really fun to dance to.  \n\nSo I think these two songs are the best example of what I was talking about.  Can you see how the vocals blend really well together in \u201cI Want to Be Loved\u201d?  Can you see how the rhythm of the song is just right for some songs in the mix?  The other songs that I\u2019ve chosen are the ones that have the sort of \u201cperfect blend of song and performance\u201d quality that I was describing.  \n\nNow that we have a better idea of what these songs sound like, let me play it for you.  I\u2019ve got a playlist on my iPhone that has an iPod shuffle set to play these songs in order.  I was thinking that we could go through this together, playing the songs and discussing which ones you want to put in the mix tape.  Are you excited for that?  Okay, let\u2019s play!  \n\nHere are some samples of the songs.  I want to start with the first one, \u201cI Want to Be Loved\u201d.  This is a really strong song, isn\u2019t it?  It has a really good rhythm and an emotional, powerful voice, and it sounds really good together with \u201cAll I Want\u201d.  \n\nHere is \u201cAll I Want\u201d, I love the vocals in this song.  Leaona has a really beautiful tone to her voice, and she\u2019s very talented.  \n\nThe third song is \u201cGetaway\u201d by Kilo Kish.  I like this one a lot, it\u2019s a really good pop song.  Kilo Kish is a very talented singer, and her voice is great in this song.  \n\nThe fourth song is \u201cCrazy\u201d by Chris Brown.  This is a really great, fun song.  It\u2019s got a really great beat that\u2019s easy to move to.  \n\nThe fifth song is \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d by Selena Gomez.  This is a really emotional song, and it\u2019s also very well performed.  The vocal performance is really strong, and it sounds really good with the other songs.  \n\nThe last song is \"Falling Down\" by Colbie Caillat.  I really like this song, it\u2019s a sort of acoustic ballad.  Colbie Caillat has a really beautiful voice, and it sounds really good with the other songs.  \n\nThe end!  Did you like hearing the songs, and discussing which ones you wanted to put in the mix tape?  I think they sound fantastic together.\n\nHuman: they really do!  that was a fun way to do it, i really liked listening to the songs and deciding which ones i wanted to include.\n\nAssistant&mdash;I really hope you do want to include these songs in a mix tape!  If you ever want to listen to one of them again, I have the audio files for you!

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to sew a fitted sheet for my queen sized mattress and want to know how much fabric to buy.\n\nAssistant: OK, so sewing fitted sheets can be a bit tricky because of how the threads twist on the bed if they\u2019re sewn tightly, but that can be done, you just need to make sure to have a minimum of 1/4\" of seam allowance around the edges of the mattress. That\u2019s because the mattress flexes on all sides, and so it can move the fabric from its intended position if it\u2019s sewn too tightly. That said, you\u2019ll want to decide what your final size will be after taking the mattress size into account, because if you don\u2019t, you may end up wasting a lot of fabric.

Once you have those, you want to lay them out along the edge of the mattress and stitch around the four edges, using a 1/4\" seam allowance. That should get you a piece of fabric that\u2019s the correct size for your mattress."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have many people executed on death row been later found to be innocent?\n\nAssistant: If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution. In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person. Some other cases have been overturned because of legal or other issues, such as new evidence or appeals and challenges by defense lawyers.  There is also the small category of executions of people who were found to be innocent after their executions. In general, very few people on death row have been exonerated or pardoned or released.\n\nHuman: So everyone executed by the state has been guilty?\n\nAssistant: This is a more complicated question that you asked.  It is true that there have been some cases where a person on death row was actually found to be innocent, and thus executed. But it is also true that there have been some people on death row who were convicted, but for reasons of inadequate evidence, weak case construction, incompetence by the prosecutor or defense lawyer,\n\nHuman: Would that make the courts murderers if they kill innocent people?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution. In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person. Some other cases have been overturned because of legal or other issues, such as new evidence or appeals and challenges by defense lawyers.  There is also the small category of executions of people who were found to be innocent after their executions. In general, very few people on death row have been exonerated or pardoned or released.\n\nHuman: So everyone executed by the state has been guilty?\n\nAssistant: This is a more complicated question that you asked.

But it is also true that there have been some people on death row who were convicted, but for reasons of inadequate evidence, weak case construction, incompetence by the prosecutor or defense lawyer,\n\nHuman: Would that make the courts murderers if they kill innocent people?\n\nAssistant: No, that is not a reasonable or fair description of how the courts function.  The goal of a court is to resolve legal cases and determine guilt or innocence based on the evidence presented in a trial.  However, it is important to remember that in a trial, the judge must settle questions of law and fact, the jury must decide whether the defendant is guilty as charged, and the judge must make rulings on questions about the constitutionality of procedures or evidence.  These are different from executing a person on death row, where a capital penalty is imposed and that is followed by execution by state execution officials.  \n\nWhen considering the morality of capital punishment, it is important to note that capital punishment has been used in many legal systems around the world.  In many countries, the death penalty is a legal option for solving crimes that cannot be solved by other means.  However, as with all aspects of the criminal justice system, there are many ways to achieve the same result, and with careful consideration and planning, the use of the death penalty can be a useful tool for solving crimes, deterrence, and justice for victims and their families."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.  In a pot on a burner, combine water and flour to make a kind of paste.  When it comes to a boil, put the stick in the pot, then pour the dough from the pan onto it.  With the stick, roll out the dough into a long rectangle, then keep rolling it until it\u2019s about 1-1.5 cm thick, and finally put it on the pan.  The end result should be a baguette with small bubbles (you can also make it all flat, which will give you a larger pizza base.)  Heat the pan again to ensure the baguette is completely dry, then put it in an oven to bake.  That\u2019s really all there is to it, and you can make baguettes in as little as 15 minutes!\n\nHuman: Do you think you can give me exact measurements for the water and flour?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about the book  Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. Whats the general plot?\n\nAssistant: El inca or Don Quixote de la Mancha was a novelist and an early Spanish epic literature. It was written in the early 16th century. Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy. Don Quixote, based on the name of a legendary Spanish nobleman, was at first a simple and good-hearted hidalgo who was obsessed with stories of knights-errant.

If for some reasons a cleaning hasn\u2019t been enough, the dentist will perform a more detailed cleaning called a \u201cgadling\u201d or \u201cdeep cleaning.\u201d  However, root canal therapy is sometimes necessary in the early stages of a tooth decay and is generally a safe and effective procedure.  In fact, there are now many types of root canal therapy that are performed with very little pain and with excellent results."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are some places you can visit in the USA that have historic significance?\n\nAssistant: It depends a little bit on the country you\u2019re from. In the US, we have a lot of museums and historical locations that are a great deal of fun to visit, and we\u2019re just not very close to a lot of them. We do have the White House, which used to be the home of our current president. That\u2019s pretty neat.\n\nHuman: I live in the US but over in the west coast there is not much to see., do you have any suggestions of places to visit?\n\nAssistant: There are definitely interesting historical sites in the west coast.  Most of them are from around the end of World War II, but we also have some pretty cool ones from the American Revolution, and we have two local museums I\u2019d recommend:\n\nHuman: yes I want something old like from civil war times and before.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not sure what \u201ccivil war times\u201d refers to.

My previous response was about the American Civil War, which was a war between two sides in the US, that started in 1861 and ended in 1865.  It\u2019s important because it was the first big war in the US and it had a huge impact on the country, and in particular it had a huge impact on the African American community."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet. Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.  You\u2019ll want to get a young chinchilla that you can socialize with others, and not just its parents, because that will help it be happier in the long-term.\n\nHuman: Do  they not do well on their own? I'm not sure I want more than one Chinchilla.\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are very social, and need to be able to be around other animals as they mature.  If you keep them on their own, they will likely start to act more like a wild animal.  One chinchilla needs about 12 square feet of space, and two would need twice that, so they\u2019d need a very large cage, but it should be comfortable for them.\n\nHuman: What kind of food will I have to feed them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are herbivores.  They\u2019ll eat a range of fruits and veggies, as well as hay and pellets.  You could buy a premixed diet that's specially made for chinchillas, which is a combination of grains, legumes, and vegetables.\n\nHuman: How long could I expect them to live on average?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.

However, they are known to live much longer in human homes, on average surviving up to 20 years.  Most adult chinchillas are spayed or neutered, however small populations can still have puppies and kittens which can result in birthrates that are higher than the normal population."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep a baby's teeth clean?\n\nAssistant: You want to make sure that your baby has plenty of liquids, not too much fluoride toothpaste, and you can try brushing their teeth twice a day.  Can I ask more questions about this?\n\nHuman: Oh, great. That makes a lot of sense.\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else you\u2019d like me to explain?\n\nHuman: Yeah, should I use toothpaste at all?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep a baby's teeth clean?\n\nAssistant: You want to make sure that your baby has plenty of liquids, not too much fluoride toothpaste, and you can try brushing their teeth twice a day.

If you use too much toothpaste, it can actually harm your baby\u2019s teeth, so a little goes a long way.  You can also use a fluoride mouthwash, but I wouldn\u2019t use that in place of toothpaste.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Israeli dishes. Can you give me a recipe Israeli Cheese Bourekas?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Israeli dishes. Can you give me a recipe Israeli Cheese Bourekas?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can help with that!  Bourekas are large, open-cupcakes made of a type of cheese and a sort of sauce that are topped with more cheese and sometimes another ingredient.  You could make a cheese pizza, or perhaps a sort of a rich \"gratin\", but this is the most similar to the classic Israeli dish you mentioned. \n\nThe cheese itself varies, but it is most often a sort of soft, yellow or white cheese like Koshari.  There are many varieties of Koshari, but they are usually made of a mix of two ingredients:\n\n1.  Rice flour or chickpea flour\n\n2.  A white salty mixture called \"gula malabari\" (or to a lesser extent, \"agartha\")\n\nThe flour is mixed with a bit of water to make a dough.  Then it is rolled out and stacked to make a sort of \"pizza\".  There are many different styles of this, some with tomato, some with sauce, some with a variety of fillings, but it is the cheese and the rice or chickpea dough that give it its distinct character.\n\nOnce the \"pizza\" is finished, it is baked in the oven.  The cheese becomes very melted and gooey, and the top is exposed to a very hot oven for about 10-15 minutes.\n\nI hope this is helpful!  If you\u2019d like to learn more about Koshari, I think it would be really interesting to explore, since it sounds like a very diverse and interesting food.  Do you want to learn more about Koshari in general, or maybe the ingredients of the dough and the cheese?"}

There are a variety of considerations to make when deciding whether to freeze your eggs, including:\n\n1.  Are you looking to have children in the future?\n2.  Are your eggs still fertile (able to create a viable baby)?\n3.  Are you in the right age range to freeze your eggs (in most countries, this is between the ages of 18-30)?\n4.  Are you in a position to take the time and effort involved in freezing and thawing your eggs?\n5.  Are you in a position to financially support the costs of freezing your eggs?"}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can back pain be a precursor to something more serious?\n\nAssistant: Back pain can be a symptom of many different issues, including degenerative disc disease, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, tumor, spina bifida, a pinched nerve, a ruptured disk, or a combination of those. But without a full medical evaluation it can be difficult to determine whether there are any underlying health issues causing your back pain.\n\nHuman: Could I have a swollen organ causing back pain?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Can back pain be a precursor to something more serious?\n\nAssistant: Back pain can be a symptom of many different issues, including degenerative disc disease, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, tumor, spina bifida, a pinched nerve, a ruptured disk, or a combination of those.

For example, an enlarged spleen can cause back pain on one side of the body.  But the spleen is located deep within your abdomen, so it can be difficult for doctors to feel it with their hands.  Spleen tumors are also likely to cause back pain."}
