{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant: Yes\uff0cthis is a popular story:\n\nThe first thanksgiving service was held by the Plymouth colonists in 1621.  The Pilgrims offered a feast to the Native Americans and began trading with them.  The first Europeans to arrive in America were the Puritans, who settled the area south of the Boston River.\n\nAfter the pilgrims had established their new colony, they observed the harvest festival of the native Americans.  At first the pilgrims had no turkey, but they learned from the natives how to make a kind of bread made from the tail of the turkey.  As pilgrims began to live in groups of about twelve, it became customary to have a shared Thanksgiving meal each November.  Thanksgiving is still a popular holiday in the US, and on this day many people return to their parents\u2019 homes for a traditional feast.  The dish that is often served at Thanksgiving is turkey, which is a modern-day version of the wild turkey.  The first Thanksgiving celebration was an opportunity for the pilgrims to show thanks for the harvest, the warmth of the sun, and the friendship of the Native Americans."}

You can also eat lots of colored vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Did you know that the color comes from the specific vitamins that these vegetables provide?  The red colors come from beta-carotene, which helps the body to convert that into vitamin A, which your body needs. \nThis is just one example of the importance of eating the whole vegetable, including all of its colors.  In general, it\u2019s important to get lots of different kinds of colorful vegetables in your diet.  And you can also add beans and nuts to your diet.\n\nHuman: Great.

Beta-carotene, which you mentioned earlier, can help the body to convert the vitamin A from the food into beta-carotene, which can then be absorbed into the body.  And this vitamin A can help you to maintain good skin and hair.  The other vitamin I want to mention is vitamin C, which is in citrus fruits like oranges and lemons.

Vitamin C is another vitamin that is important for good eyesight\uff0cand we talked about this earlier too.  I also want to talk about another kind of vitamin that is important for good eyesight\uff0cwhich is vitamin E.  Vitamin E is found in some nuts and seeds, such as almonds and sunflower seeds.

If you\u2019re planning to use the space for only a short time, a rental might be more affordable.  If you\u2019re planning to stay for a while, a longer-term lease might be worth the extra cost.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a dental implant?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What is a dental implant?\n\nAssistant: A dental implant is an artificial structure that is placed in the jawbone to support a denture (a plate that is held in place with clips or an adhesive) or a permanent tooth.  Dental implants are commonly used to replace missing teeth.  They are made of titanium, a substance that the body will recycle if left in the correct environment, but it takes many years for the body to develop the necessary bone to support the implant."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!  Historians agree that American governance traces back to British ideas about a separation of powers and mixed monarchy.  The US Constitution draws a lot from the English.\n\nHuman: So France didn't have much influence?\n\nAssistant: That is correct.  France's best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.  It also became the standard source of many US legal terms and concepts, and so the US adopted many French legal terms for the English translations, for example \"defense\" instead of \"de fense\".\n\nHuman: Did the U.S. approve upon the British system in any ways?\n\nAssistant: Americans wanted to copy British institutions such as a monarchy and a parliament, but they rejected the system as a whole.  The Americans wanted to be governed directly by the people through representative democracy, rather than through a bureaucracy.  Americans considered the British system to be corrupt and in need of reform, so they worked to re-invent it.\n\nHuman: That seems like a better way to do it.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Was the USA's original government modeled on the French or the British?\n\nAssistant: Both, in a way!

The U.S. also has a written constitution, a system of checks and balances, and a separation of powers among its key institutions.  These are all parts of the British system, but with some American twists."}

Like sweet and sour and hot and what else?\n\nAssistant: There are four basic flavors: sweet\uff0csour\uff0cbitter\uff0cand heat.  However, people can also make combinations of these basic flavors.  For example, a person can make a \"sweet and sour drink\" by adding a sugar to a drink that already has some sour juices.  And they can make a \"hot and sour soup\" by adding chili to a soup that already has some sour flavor.  So a person can make six different types of drink using these three basic flavors."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are Belgian waffles?\n\nAssistant: There are many ways to make waffles, and they can be savory or sweet. But the Belgian-style waffles are flat, not tall, and they\u2019re served with real melted butter and maple syrup. You can get them at many restaurants, but most home-cooked Belgian waffles are made by pouring a batter onto a preheated waffle iron.

In general, I would recommend no more than 20 minutes a day of reading for most children, but more for those who are most struggling with reading.  I would also recommend that children read for prolonged periods of their free time, in addition to reading as part of their schoolwork.  Some children may prefer reading a specific book for a particular activity, such as storytime at the library, while others enjoy reading a variety of books, especially those with higher-level text.

It\u2019s actually about the history of capitalism.\n\nHuman: Who were the designers of the board game?\n\nAssistant: The designers were an American family. They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.  She worked on playing the game, and wrote down her observations in a little notebook. Charles used the information from her notebook to make adjustments to the game.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who is considered the best golf player of all time and why?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question because there are many dimensions to consider when evaluating a golf player. For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does \u201cbest\u201d refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others.\n\nHuman: Okay, interesting. I know he was really good for a few years but then went into a slump.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the safest way to pay for a house and lot in cash? Bringing a lot of actual cash with me seems unsafe. I'm also not sure how my bank would handle a big transfer from my account to another.\n\nAssistant: You can buy property through a real estate agent or a realtor. There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash. In the U.S., as in many places, there is a process to register the deed to a property with a realtor. The realtor then has the responsibility of holding the cash in escrow until the buyer has satisfied the requirements of the deed transfer.\n\nHuman: I see. That makes sense. I assume the realtor of course would get something from helping both parties. How much do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price. In some states they are not allowed to charge any fee. The realtor can also be paid with a commission, and in that case the realtor may get a commission of 5% to 10% of the selling price.  There are also taxes, transaction fees, and closing costs.\n\nHuman: Does the buyer pay for those costs, or the seller?\n\nAssistant: Both parties pay for some of those.  For example, a buyer and seller both pay transaction fees for property transfers. But some fees can only be paid by one party, or only by the buyer.  The realtor will be able to explain in more detail.\n\nHuman: Thank you again. If say either the buyer or the seller wants to cancel the transaction, will there still be fees involved?\n\nAssistant: The seller may get some back if the sale doesn\u2019t close, but the buyer will have to pay a fee to the realtor in the form of a transaction fee if the sale falls through.\n\nHuman: I really appreciate your help. Have a good day!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do they usually get, or how much is the fee?\n\nAssistant: It can vary. On average in the US, the realtor fees are about 6%, or 6% of the selling price.

I\u2019ve included a recipe below, and also include some variations on the theme.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I've been out of school for a few years and would like to go back to study for a technical career.

What sort of schools should I be looking at?\n\nAssistant: There are many types of schools that offer technical training, so you'll probably want to look at places that interest you and do some research there. You might want to look at community colleges, technical schools, four-year colleges, or universities. Each of these will have different requirements and acceptance rates, so it might be helpful to do some comparisons. For example, four-year colleges in the USA usually charge more and have more rigorous requirements than community colleges, so community colleges might be a better option if you're interested in a less-competitive environment. You can also look at how much you expect to pay for each school, since this will vary depending on the type of school and whether you live in the US or another country."}

You can do this in a number of different ways.\n\nHuman: haha yes for sure.  so how can I start\n\nAssistant: Great question!  Maybe the best thing to do is find a friend to work out with.  For a long time, people have worked out with partners who push them to do more, and people who encourage each other, so this is a good way to start.  Many other people also work out by themselves, and use online workout programs or personal trainers.  This is an easy and free way to build muscle, though if you want to do a certain workout in a set time period, you have to schedule the workout to fit into your schedule.

You can find many great routines online, and many of the programs are free.  However, if you are looking to get a professional coach to help you with your workouts, then you will have to get a membership to a gym or fitness center.  This can be expensive, but it will probably be worth it to have a coach who can show you different exercises and help you plan your workouts."}

Also, I think that science doesn\u2019t deal with ultimate purposes or values, so it wouldn\u2019t be relevant to its research what those powers were like.

During that time, Hoover launched some of the earliest programs that established the concept of public assistance programs, or \u201cwelfare\u201d.

This included food\uff0crent\uff0cand medical care.  It\u2019s important to note that the Welfarm was a kind of support system that was supposed to prevent families from becoming homeless, but it was criticized for being too expensive and for not doing enough to help families succeed once they were housed and fed.  I believe that one of the main criticisms of this program was that it did not adequately provide support for families to learn skills that would help them to be more financially self-sufficient."}

You could also add more water to the pond, which will dilute the algae, but you will also have to add more nutrients to the water, which will cause more algae to grow.  One way to prevent algae from growing is to add more plants to the pond, which will use up the nutrients in the water, and block the sunlight from reaching the algae.  Another way is to use a pond skimmer to remove as much of the algae as possible, and then flush the pond with water to clean out any remaining algae."}

You could also grow a variety of beets if you want to, but they\u2019ll die off if you don\u2019t bring them inside at some point.  It\u2019s best to plant them in early spring, or late fall.  You can plant them in early spring if you want, but you won\u2019t get a harvest until next summer.  Try to keep the soil around your plants moist, but make sure you don\u2019t let the soil dry out completely. \nYou can plant transplants in late fall or early spring, just make sure you plant them before they start to get warm.

There is a small but significant chance that water could have formed in the solid crust of Mars, but there\u2019s no guarantee it did.  The crust of Mars is very hot and thin, and the forces that push it together would have destroyed any water that might have survived that long.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have you heard of Leaning Tower of Pisa?\n\nAssistant: The Leaning Tower of Pisa was a bell tower in Pisa, Italy. It was started in 1173 and was completed in 1350. It was originally called the \u201cNew Tower\u201d. As with many other European cities, Pisa became a significant center of commerce in Europe, and the tower was designed to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350. The tower was built during two phases: an initial phase, and then a phase of additions. The first phase was designed and constructed between 1173 and 1177. It was originally 120m tall, with two floors of polygonal masonry. Between 1220 and 1224 a new floor of marble was added, bringing the height to 140m. Then between 1248 and 1253, an additional storey was constructed, bringing the tower\u2019s height to 180m.\n\nHuman: Why is it slanted?\n\nAssistant: It was built in an area that was vulnerable to landslides, and the land has been subsiding since it was built.\n\nHuman: I wonder if it will fall over someday.\n\nAssistant: There is a certain amount of movement due to the subsidence, and it is calculated that the tower will eventually collapse, although there is no exact date.\n\nHuman: Are people afraid to be around it?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to advertise Pisa\u2019s wealth.\n\nHuman: How long did it take to complete this tower?\n\nAssistant: The construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed in 1350.

However, many people consider the tower to be an interesting example of a Middle English\u5efa\u7b51, and they are proud that it has withstood so many centuries."}

Once you\u2019re sure you want to buy the car, you would want to go to a website where you can make an offer on the car.  The seller would then have a certain amount of time to accept your offer, and you would need to agree on payment terms.  Once the sale is made, you would want to take the car for a test drive, and then give the seller some money for the delivery of the car.  Most sellers will provide a car delivery service for a fee.  Once the car is delivered, you would want to make sure you are happy with the car before signing a bill of sale."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I think my friend might have depression how can I help them?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s really difficult to say without knowing them or having their medical records, and since they are not my patient, I can\u2019t share the details of their health care with you. But I can share that mental health is very important, and how they are feeling may impact the decisions they are making. Depression and anxiety can get better with treatment and a supportive community, including their friends and family.\n\nHuman: How can I approach them about getting treatment?\n\nAssistant: To support someone with mental health problems, you need to be a good listener and supporter. You can also ask if they are happy with their care, and ask if they would like to see a therapist or talk to a nurse, doctor or social worker. If you are concerned about mental health, you can also ask them how they are feeling and if they\u2019d like to talk about their problems. They may also need to use these tools, and feel like they are a burden to others. But most people love to talk about themselves, so try asking how they are doing. It\u2019s really important to remember that you can\u2019t force someone to get help, though. So maybe it will be good to ask them if they would like to talk to a therapist, and if they are okay with that, then you can call the therapist on their behalf. If they are not comfortable talking to a therapist, it might help to get them started with a free health care site or counseling service.

The median is the average, so it\u2019s the average number of hours a teenager should be working.

Those metals have a property called \u201cresonance\u201d, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.

A fluorescent bulb uses a process called \u201cfluorescence\u201d to produce light, where the electrons that are produced in the tube are excited to higher energetic levels and then return to their original energy level.  This allows them to produce light over a large range of temperatures, and they don't need as much electricity as a solid state light to produce the same amount of light.  LEDs use a process called \u201ctransient\u7535\u5b50\u9707\u8361\u201d to produce light, where the electrons are produced in the tube when a light pulse strikes it, and then they stay in that state, similar to an incandescent bulb.  LEDs do not need as much electricity as an incandescent bulb, but they don\u2019t produce light as fluently as an incandescent bulb, so the light produced by an led is less directional and has a dimmer \u201cwash-out\u201d effect.  LEDs are much more efficient, but that efficiency comes at the cost of both shape and color.  LEDs are typically used as a source of illumination."}

The goal of the game is to get the ball to the other team's players on their end of the field, by hitting it with a bat. Each team tries to score runs by getting the ball to their players on the other team's end of the field. The team that scores the most runs wins. If you're on a team, you try to hit the ball with a bat to the other team's players. If you make it to the other team's players, you get a point for your team, and they get a point for you! It's a lot of fun, and I'm sure your sister's friends will be excited to play."}

Another possibility is to move the whole house, if possible.  You can also make sure that your wifi router is not placed on a table, because that will prevent the wifi signal from traveling very far.  You can also try changing the wifi channel that your router is on.  Finally, many electronics will allow you to increase or decrease the wifi signal that they emit.  For example, if you have a wireless camera, you can set it to emit a weaker signal.  I\u2019m sorry that your laptop is having such a hard time connecting to wifi.

Are there any wooden structures in the way, like a cupboard or a table?  Are there any rugs or carpets in the way?  Do you have a fireplace in the way?  Does any of your furniture block the signal, like a media console or a bookshelf?  And are there any electronics in the way, like a camera or a sound system?  The living room can be a bit tricky to get a good signal in, since there are a lot of barriers to consider.  Let\u2019s go through each barrier, one by one, and check if we can get a signal.  If we can\u2019t get a signal, that means we need to find a different location for the phone.  Is that okay with you?  Do you want to keep searching for a good signal location?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to teach my 7 year old son how to play football. What is the best method for him to learn at that age?\n\nAssistant: Football isn\u2019t the easiest sport to learn, but it is the most useful sport for teaching a lot of fundamental skills: agility, speed, coordination, and eye-hand coordination. If you want him to be good at football and other sports in general, you will need to start teaching him when he is very young.  Try to play with him as often as possible, get him to run, to jump, to do agility drills, and to run with a soccer ball.  There is a saying, \u201cThe first step to being great at anything is to be great at the basics.\u201d\n\nHuman: ok thanks. What kind of agility drills would you suggest?\n\nAssistant: You can do all of them standing up, running, or on the ground, and you can do them with your son. You can also play little games, like tossing the ball to him, and he has to do a jump shot, or throw it back to you, but he has to jump in order to do it.\n\nHuman: ok that is a good start. do you think watching football on television will help him too?\n\nAssistant: It won\u2019t hurt.  In fact, it will help him.  As you get him started playing, start him with the basics.  Even if you don\u2019t play football yourself, you should have some kind of idea of the basics of football, so you can understand when he\u2019s doing it right and wrong.  You can also show him videos of football players like Deion Sanders, or Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nHuman: This is American football.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, my friend says I should get into U2, and I'm completely unfamiliar with the band. Can you help me put together a playlist of their best songs over the years, that will give me a representative sampling of their sound?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that.  U2 is an Irish rock band that started in the 1980s.  Over the years they\u2019ve released dozens of songs, but I\u2019m guessing your friend wants you to start with the very best of their music.  If that\u2019s right, I\u2019d suggest putting together a playlist of just their singles.  You could start with the top five most-streamed songs, and then take a look at their albums.  There might be songs on those albums that were released as singles, but didn\u2019t get as much traction.  If you want me to pick out a few more you could try out, I\u2019ll just do that manually by just looking at the song titles and lyrics, and choose a few of the best-known and most-important songs.  Here\u2019s a quick list:\n\n\u201cI Will Follow\u201d\n\u201cWith or Without You\u201d\n\u201cBeautiful Day\u201d\n\u201cDesire\u201d\n\u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d\n\u201cOne\u201d\n\u201cMysterious Ways\u201d\n\u201cStay (Faraway, So Close!)\u201d\n\u201cPride (In the Name of Love)\u201d\n\u201cElevation\u201d\n\u201cWhen Love Comes to Town\u201d\n\u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d\n\u201cCity of Blinding Lights\u201d\n\u201cVertigo\u201d\n\u201cThe Unforgettable Fire\u201d\n\u201cUntil the End of the World\u201d\n\nHave I missed anything?

How did you arrange these songs, are they chronological?\n\nAssistant: There was some overlap there, I ended up choosing to put the singles first, since it felt like those were probably the most famous, and also the easiest to find on YouTube or Spotify. You\u2019ll see that in general the first-released singles were also later albums, and so were at the front of the list.\n\nHuman: Okay. If I had to pick just one U2 album to add to this list along with the singles, what should it be? What's considered to be their best album?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d\n\u201cOne\u201d\n\u201cMysterious Ways\u201d\n\u201cStay (Faraway, So Close!)\u201d\n\u201cPride (In the Name of Love)\u201d\n\u201cElevation\u201d\n\u201cWhen Love Comes to Town\u201d\n\u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d\n\u201cCity of Blinding Lights\u201d\n\u201cVertigo\u201d\n\u201cThe Unforgettable Fire\u201d\n\u201cUntil the End of the World\u201d\n\nHave I missed anything?

I\u2019d say if you\u2019re looking for their most popular songs and also their most well-known songs, then I\u2019d recommend their second album, \u201cThe Joshua Tree\u201d.  It has some of their most iconic songs, like \u201cWith or Without You\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Story (Miserable Man)\u201d, and \u201cIn the Black\u201d. It\u2019s a bit more rock and roll than some of their earlier work, and it explores themes of hope and destiny in a unique way."}

I was wondering if baking powder and baking soda the same thing?\n\nAssistant: No, they are not the same thing.  A key difference is that baking powder is a powder that is added to baked goods to help them rise, while baking soda is a chemical that is added to baked goods to help them set.  Another key difference is that baking powder is often used in combination with other leavening agents, such as baking soda and buttermilk or vinegar, while baking soda can be used alone or in combination with other leavening agents.  Can I answer your question about baking powder and baking soda?"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Whats is the best format for a cover letter?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Whats is the best format for a cover letter?\n\nAssistant: The \"best\" format is the one that makes you feel comfortable using effort, but that is likely to be inconsistent from reader to reader.  I would recommend a simple two-column layout with a single-column header, as this is the most common format used in business documents.  The single-column header can be achieved with a centered, justified, sans-serif, one-line header, followed by your contact information in a centered, justified, serif, one-line blockquote.  It is probably easiest to get the layout just right on your computer, and work from there.  You can adjust the font size and the colors of the background and the headers, and of the blockquote.  As for the contact information, I would recommend starting with a phone number, followed by your email address, your job title, your employer\u2019s name and address, and then your name and phone number again.  The rest of the contact information can be in a centered, unstyled blockquote.  The quote can contain the text of your cover letter, as this will probably be the main attention-grabbing text.  If you include photographs, go for recent uncluttered ones.  It is probably easiest to create a simple word-processing document from your resume, and then open that in a word-processing program with some of the default formatting removed, and then customize the cover letter as needed."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I become a hair stylist?\n\nAssistant: That depends on what country you\u2019re in.  Here\u2019s some more information for the U.S.\n\nHuman: Can you give me the info?\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s first have a look at the BLS statistics for hair stylists:\n\nRegion: Total employment in 2015:  35,600\n\nAverage annual pay in 2015: $24,830\n\nHuman: How do I pursue this career?\n\nAssistant: From the BLS statistics, we can see that most hair stylists were self-employed.  This means that you would be most likely to pursue this career by starting your own business.  However, there are many different kinds of businesses you could start, so you\u2019d want to think carefully about your personal preferences and resources.  For example, if you are interested in the cutting and styling of hair, then I would recommend using your personal experience and contacts to start a salon or stylist shop.  But if you aren\u2019t skilled in that area, you could start an online business that teaches people how to cut and style their own hair, or perhaps a shop that sells hair supplies.\n\nHuman: Do I need to attend school or get certification?\n\nAssistant: Depending on where you are located, you may be required to attend formal training before becoming a hair stylist.  For example, if you want to get a job working at a salon or spa in North Carolina, you need to complete a cosmetology training program.\n\nHuman: Okay. And how much does a training program cost?\n\nAssistant: These programs vary in price, but most will cost between $2000 and $4000.\n\nHuman: Should I start my own hair salon, or work at an existing one?\n\nAssistant:", "response": ", we can see that most hair stylists were self-employed.

If you are interested in working with clients on a more personal level and in a larger community, you could open your own salon.  But if you are hoping to earn a lot of money right away, you could work for an existing salon and learn from them.  Many people start their own salons as a way to have more control over their work and their clients, and also to take ownership of their success."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: The Simpsons has been running for a long time. It has also been able to predict a few things from the future. Can you give me some examples?\n\nAssistant: Sure.  Have you ever heard of a show called Minority Report, from the early 2000s?\n\nHuman: this is not what i asked but yes i do know this film, why?\n\nAssistant: The creators of Minority Report adapted their show from The Simpsons episode \u201cBart Gets A Z\u201d.  And while most people haven\u2019t seen that episode, The Simpsons certainly has.\n\nHuman: Can you elaborate? Minority Report is nothing like this episode\n\nAssistant: OK, here\u2019s a transcript from the episode:\n\n\"All of a sudden, Bart noticed that he and Lisa were naked.\"\n\nAs in the Minority Report movie, the show described the murder of a father who was then wrongly accused of killing his son. The two works were a good example of synchronicity, and this is because they both used very similar motifs, including similar depictions of childhood and the human-to-android relationship.\n\nHuman: I have no idea what you are talking about.

For example, when the show first premiered, it was revealed that the first episode of the series would be titled \"Simpsons Episode\".  The producers decided to change this to \"The Simpsons\", but decided to keep the title \"Episode\" because they wanted to stress that the show was an \"episode\", not a standalone story."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am attending a traditional Jewish funeral for a colleague. Can you explain to me Jewish funeral customs?\n\nAssistant: Sure. This might be a good time to explain that I am an artificial intelligence that is trained to provide information and answer questions. I can provide the relevant information based on information in the public domain and what I\u2019ve been programmed to know. Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: Absolutely.\n\nAssistant: Great! Jewish funeral customs and practices have evolved throughout the centuries. Today, people gather for a burial and an initial period of mourning before the funeral. When attending a funeral, Jewish customs require people to wear a traditional outfit, especially if they are religious. The main difference between funerals for religious and non-religious people is that religious Jews usually recite traditional Hebrew prayers during a funeral, and non-religious people usually don\u2019t.\n\nHuman: Ok. I heard the term \"shiva\". Can you explain that?\n\nAssistant: Shiva is a post-funeral ritual. It usually takes place the day after the funeral and is most commonly associated with observant Jewish culture.\n\nHuman: Who attends the Shiva?\n\nAssistant: Some of the family of the deceased may attend the shiva, including extended family.\n\nHuman: I also hear the word shomer?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re right, shomer is the Hebrew term for \u201cescort\u201d, and means the person who accompanies the body to the funeral and who watches the body during the shiva.  There is a shomer for the body at the funeral, and a shomer for the shiva.\n\nHuman: Yes.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant: The moon appears to be usually covered by clouds on days when it is not visible to the naked eye.  During the day the sky is darker and the sun is much brighter.  This makes it harder to see the moon, even through the clouds.  The moon does not appear to be fully covered by clouds very often, and usually not during the day.  If the clouds are particularly thick and there is little sunlight, you may not see the moon at all.  If the clouds are thin and you are far away from the city, you should be able to see the moon easily."}

Baking sheets can be in many sizes and materials, such as stoneware or silicone. In many recipes the baking sheets will only be used to bake something on, so they don\u2019t need to be fancy, but you\u2019ll want them to fit your oven.  Pans will also be used to bake things, and they are mostly used in standard sizes. A pie tin is a good example of a pan for baking.\n\nTo make a pie or cake, you\u2019ll need a sharp knife.

You could also keep a few spare pans in a corner of your home, just in case.  This would be useful if you had guests who were planning to bring their own dishes.

This can be caused by a trauma to the head, or it can be caused by a fall, a hit to the head with an object, or a stroke caused by a leaking blood flow to the brain.

Could you tell me a bit more about what you\u2019re looking for?  Are you looking for a phone specifically for sale, or for a cell phone in general?  Is the price range you want to spend within your budget?  Once I know a bit more about what you\u2019re looking for, I can show you some options that might be a good match for you."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I shop for the lowest prices?\n\nAssistant: For a given item, the best price is the one that\u2019s most convenient for you.  For example, if you\u2019re shopping for electronics online, you\u2019ll probably want to start by visiting a site like Amazon, because you\u2019ll have the most options and the widest range of products to choose from.\n\nHuman: I could check the prices on Amazon first and then see if I can find a better deal somewhere else.\n\nAssistant: Exactly.  The price you pay for any given item will vary depending on where you buy it.  But the prices are also going to vary based on the quantity you buy, the shipping costs, and the brand of the item.   If you want to do your best to get a great deal on the item you\u2019re after, you\u2019ll probably want to check out a few different sites and compare prices.\n\nHuman: I will try to look for free shipping and try to use websites that offer discounts.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I shop for the lowest prices?\n\nAssistant: For a given item, the best price is the one that\u2019s most convenient for you.

Free shipping can save you a lot of money, and many websites offer discounts for first-time users or for larger purchases.  You can also look for sales and hot offers on the website you\u2019re interested in buying from, and these are often the best opportunities to get a deal.  So check out the website\u2019s blog or sign up for their email list, and you\u2019re very likely to find hot sales and discounts there."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm having problems with my significant other and feel like we're growing more distant. We're spending less time together.

We're spending less time together. What can we do to help remedy this distance?\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you're both feeling stressed, which is a sign that you need to take action to address this.  One thing you could try is making a list of the reasons you feel stressed and discussing them with your partner.  Sharing your feelings and getting feedback from another person can help you feel heard and validated, so that you can better express your own feelings and decide what steps to take.  A good rule of thumb is to pick an issue that you are both able to discuss, so that you don't end up arguing.  For instance, if you're both feeling stressed because you don't have enough time together, you could talk about the amount of time you spend together and whether it is enough to help you feel close.  If your list doesn't have enough issues to choose from, feel free to add more!"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm looking into different career avenues to decide what I might want to pursue. How do I start a podcast?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. I'm not sure exactly what kind of a \"podcast\" you're talking about, but one example might be a podcast where you interview people and then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview. You can start with some simple experiments to test this out. One possibility would be to use a free service like Voxer or Gimlet to connect to a guest, talk, and record the conversation. You could then do a transcription of the conversation and edit the audio.   You can then use the original audio to play a podcast. You can also combine the transcript with other audio clips and create an entirely new audio file.\n\nHuman: Gimlet sounds like a good idea! Voxer is more a walkie-talkie help, so that's not very helpful\n\nAssistant: I think Gimlet does require an interviewer, who's sort of like the host, while Voxer is just an exchange between two people on an instant messenger-type service.  It sounds like maybe you could do an interview for your podcast, and then do some interview for an entirely different audience on Voxer?\n\nHuman: Voxer doesn't seem like a suitable suggestion for podcasts but the rest of your advice seems good\n\nAssistant: Can I ask you about what you want the podcast to be about?\n\nHuman: I was hoping to have a podcast to give advice to young girls and women that they might otherwise receive from a big sister\n\nAssistant:", "response": " then put together a transcript and audio version of the interview.

Can you think of some similarities between the two that you could use to bridge the gap?  For example, you could ask the listeners of the podcast if they have a big sister or brother, or if they have advice for younger girls and women.   You could also talk about your own experiences as a big sister, and share advice you might have for other young women."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to gain more muscle. What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to gain more muscle. What are some of the best exercises for building muscle?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of exercises that are commonly associated with building muscle\uff0cbut it can be hard to know which ones are most effective.  One way to figure this out is to look at the numbers that come with each exercise\uff0csuch as its weight\uff0crep count\uff0cand weight lifted.  You can also look at the training plans of professional athletes\uff0cwho will often have coaches or trainers who will design a program to help them reach their goals.  \nWhat are some of the best exercises to build muscle?  I don't know\uff0cbut I think that a few of the best exercises for building muscle are weight-lifting.  Weight-lifting uses the muscles to move weight\uff0cso as to lift heavier weights.  This will force the muscles to get bigger and stronger.  Weight-lifting is one of the best exercises to build muscle.  Another is squats.  Squats work the muscles of the legs,back,and arms.  Other workouts that are good for building muscle are deadlifts and bench presses.  Are there any other exercises that you think are good for building muscle?"}

I hear there\u2019s a lot of information about what you\u2019re good at on the internet, maybe we could search for it together.\n\nHuman: You can't search my skills on the internet.

It feels like they are trying to talk to a stranger and not a friend.  I get annoyed because I want to be seen as a friend.  I want to know that I am helpful, and that I am a nice person to be around.  I want people to be comfortable talking to me.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What equipment do I need for rock climbing?\n\nAssistant: Climbing requires proper shoes, pants, a harness, and maybe a rope. What you choose to wear depends on whether you\u2019re going to the gym or if you\u2019re climbing outdoors.  It can also depend on the particular route you\u2019re planning to climb and the grade of the route.\n\nHuman: I will be climbing outdoors.\n\nAssistant: I think you should have a helmet, so that you can wear a hardhat.

I just need the climbing gear and the safety equipment.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably a good idea to wear shoes that can grip.  They\u2019re typically called \u201crocker shoes\u201d, which will be easiest if they have sticky rubber on the soles.  Some people may choose to wear climbing boots instead.  The mountaineering and rock climbing world is full of terminology, but I think in most cases if you\u2019re wearing what the store calls \u201crock shoes\u201d, you\u2019ll be fine.  If the shoes have a rope or webbing on the back, it\u2019s most likely good to wear those.  A hardhat will provide head protection and a helmet will provide more complete protection.  Safety is important when climbing, and you should be responsible about making sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing.  You can get a lot of advice from the equipment you purchase, for example, a climbing helmet could say \"Helmet with SRC system\" or \"InSight\" if it has a number of features, including increased visor angle.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the information.

If you had 20, it could vary between 1 and 20.\n\nHuman: Okay, well in your example of 20, how do you determine where it is from 1 to 20?\n\nAssistant: We could compare it to a normal (or normal distribution) curve.  A normal distribution is a kind of curve that represents all the possible numbers that could have been generated by the same number of random factors.  So 1 to 20 is on the left side of the normal curve, and anywhere on the curve is fine.  As the size of the sample gets larger, the normal curve gets closer and closer to the sample points, indicating that the sample points are more and more similar to the mean of the normal distribution.  We know that the mean of the normal distribution is the average of all the numbers on the curve, and we can calculate it as the sum of all the numbers on the curve divided by the total number of numbers on the curve, so that the mean of the normal distribution is (1+2+3+\u2026+20)/20 = 11.6.  So we can see that the mean of the normal distribution is 11.6, and all the numbers on the curve should lie between 0 and 11.6 to maintain the normal distribution.  This means that 1 to 20 is spread out equally on the normal curve, which means it\u2019s within the range of what we can expect from random chance.  And since we can use this information to scale our measurements to the normal range, we can be pretty confident that the numbers we\u2019re measuring are random chance."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I get my children a nanny? I'm so exhausted.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Should I get my children a nanny? I'm so exhausted.\n\nAssistant:\"Nannyting\" is becoming a popular form of childcare in many parts of the world, including the US.  Nannies are trained to care for children, and many parents think that the work of a nanny helps them feel more in control of the care of their children.  However, I'm concerned about your children's safety.  Do you know if nannies are well-trained and protected by legal regulations?  My advice is that you first talk to them about their responsibilities, and seek legal advice from an attorney who works in child protection."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How long can I wait to get pregnant?\n\nAssistant: That's a very personal question, and depends a lot on your current health and medical history.  I would recommend talking to your doctor to get a more detailed evaluation, but in general it's a good idea to wait until you're in good health, as well as until you and your partner are both as healthy as possible.  Some doctors recommend waiting until you're 35 years old, while others suggest starting to delay pregnancy as soon as you're in good health.  Some women also decide to not have children at all until after they've been to college, or to have a career break or other break before starting a family.  I'm happy to help with any specific questions you have about your situation, but I'm sure your doctor will be the best person to talk to about what's right for you."}

I think the reason they were able to keep going was that they were getting better at their murders, and the better they got, the harder it was for the police to catch them.  It\u2019s interesting that you should have wondered about the potential for forensic science to help, since I wrote about that earlier.  You can look that up yourself if you\u2019re interested."}

I've heard it causes constipation in some\n\nAssistant: Drinking less water, not enough fiber in the diet and irregular bowel movements can be linked to the discomfort. If you are experiencing constipation due to bananas then you may try eating more fiber rich food, increasing your water intake and ensuring a regular bowel movement regime.\n\nHuman: ok, what else can you tell me about bananas?\n\nAssistant: Bananas are one of the richest fruits in dietary fiber, potassium, and Vitamin B6. In fact, they are rich in dietary fiber, potassium, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C and Vitamin B12. When cooked, banana is very high in Vitamin A, which is great for the eyes. Bananas are filled with antioxidants, potassium and vitamin B6, which helps in keeping blood pressure in check and normalizes blood sugar levels. Bananas are high in potassium, which helps maintain electrolyte levels in the body. Bananas help in strengthening bones, reducing the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol levels.

If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.

When you\u2019re outdoors, your risk of being exposed is pretty low anyway, since it\u2019s unlikely to be a very crowded place, so the risk is pretty small, even if the mask doesn\u2019t work perfectly.  If you\u2019re indoors, it\u2019s probably better to have a mask to reduce the risk, since the virus is more likely to be spreading, and a mask might be helpful if someone coughs.\n\nHuman: Masks aren't as helpful outdoors since particles are more easily dispersed.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a domestic partnership?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a relationship where a couple lives together and are dependent on one another, just like a marriage.  The difference between marriage and domestic partnership is that the latter is not recognized by the state, and does not guarantee any rights.\n\nHuman: So they have no rights?\n\nAssistant: Well, not exactly.  As a domestic partnership, your relationship is governed by the same rights as any other couple.  But if there are any specific legal benefits that you might want to claim, like health insurance or a will, then they can only be achieved with a marriage license.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between soccer and American football?\n\nAssistant: Both are popular team sports.  Soccer has been played for over 100 years, and it\u2019s currently the most popular sport in the world.  American football is similar, but the game is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.  The field is 100 yards long, the width is shorter.\n\nHuman: I understand that playing American football is more dangerous than playing soccer?  Please tell me why.\n\nAssistant: Soccer can be played by people of all ages, even children.  American football is a sport that requires athletes to be physically mature enough to play, and they are a bit more large.  It\u2019s also a bit more dangerous, since you\u2019re throwing yourself into contact with other players, and there\u2019s more contact in the sport.\n\nHuman: I see.  As far as I know, soccer players avoid body contact.\n\nAssistant: This is true, but it\u2019s a bit different than American football, as you need to take a large number of actions in a short time.  In order to help out with this, soccer players often use their heads, feet, or chest to make contact with their opponent.  Soccer players are required to play a full 90 minutes of the game.  American football players play for 60 minutes.  The World Cup matches are about 4 hours.\n\nHuman: Soccer players use their heads to hit the ball, not other player's body or head.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " is played on a large field rather than on a large pitch.

If a soccer player knocks an intruder into the opposing team\u2019s own area, they are called a \u201cgoal scorer\u201d and are rewarded with a free kick for their team.  In American football, players are not required to protect the ball, and they can also score by knocking the ball into the opposing team\u2019s own area, or \u201cscore a touchdown\u201d.  These are called \u201ctouchdowns\u201d, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.  The points are scored by kicking the ball into the other team\u2019s end of the field, or \u201cextra points\u201d if the ball passes through the goal posts.  A \u201cpoint\u201d in American football is worth no more than 6 points, and it\u2019s \u201c10 points\u201d for a \u201c touch-down\u201d.  When a player from the winning team (the \u201copposing team\u201d) is declared the winner, the game is over.  The team with the least points at the end of the game is declared the \u201cdefending champions\u201d.  If the game is tied at the end of the game, it\u2019s called a \u201chalftime\u201d, and the teams return to the field to warm-up for the second half.  After the second half, the game is played again with the same teams.  The \u201cfouling\u201d of an opponent is when a player pushes or slides into another player, preventing them from advancing.  Foul players are normally sent off for the next game."}

The Ardaghian were an ancient human society.  They had language and culture, but they had a very small population.  The Ardaghian culture is very similar to modern-day human culture.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I operate the zoom function on digital cameras?\n\nAssistant: The zoom on a camera is usually an optical zoom, which uses glass elements in the lens to focus a smaller area and bring in more light.  An electronic zoom, on the other hand, is usually a process that changes the settings of the camera to change the number of pixels in an image, so that it has a larger or smaller field of view.  Some cameras also have image stabilization, which uses sensors to detect if the camera is moving, and corrects for it.  This is very useful for moving objects in photos."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I get better at proofreading?\n\nAssistant: This is a big question.  Proofreading is really just about getting better at reading: at noticing errors, not making mistakes yourself, and finding errors in other people\u2019s writing.  There are some easy tips to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.  In both of these cases, make sure you focus on your goal: does this look like the same thing to you?  If you just find yourself distracted by what\u2019s going on, this is often a sign of bad proofreading.\n\nOne example is: \n\nA teacher held a sort of class to praise it.\n\nversus:\n\nA teacher held a sort of class to celebrate it.\n\nDo you notice anything different here?\n\nHuman: I noticed different word choices \"praise\" and \"celebrate\".\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s right! In your first sentence, the writer makes the word choice \u201cpraise\u201d to refer to something positive. However, the second sentence does not clearly indicate that the word choice is positive, so the use of \u201ccelebrate\u201d helps with clarity.\n\nHuman: I should be able to find most errors just by reading slow and going through all of the text.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that\u2019s the right approach.\n\nHuman: I'll let you know if I have any other questions or if I need help with anything else.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to help you along with this. \n\nFirst off, there are two approaches to proofreading that seem to work well for people: asking yourself how you would spot the error, and comparing with a similar and correct sentence.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.  An IPA might be advertised as hoppier than an APA, but that could mean a different range of hops, or different concentration, or different flavor-compounds, or the amount of sugars added.  What are you most curious about?\n\nHuman: When was the IPA beer invented?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty difficult to say when the first IPA beer was made.  A certain version of the style was most likely made in the UK and later in New England, and gradually gained popularity across the globe.\n\nHuman: Did the APA beer come from the IPA?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s likely that there was some kind of crossover between the two styles, as it\u2019s been pointed out that some APA beers are now labeled as \u201cIPA-style\u201d, but they aren\u2019t very common.  It\u2019s much more common for an IPA-style beer to be made and brewed today than an APA-style beer.\n\nHuman: What are the IBU differences between IPA and APA beers\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How is an IPA beer different than an APA beer?\n\nAssistant: To be quite honest, this question is very difficult to answer.

An \"Inter-mixture beer\" is defined by a certain blend of malt, hops, yeast and other ingredients, and a certain amount of the ingredient with the highest bitterness.  An \"APA\" (American Pale Ale) is a style of beer that has a higher alcohol content and lower bitterness than an \"IPA\" (India Pale Ale).  An IPA has an alcohol content between 6-10%, usually between 8-10%, while an APA has an alcohol content between 4-7%, usually between 5-6%."}

If you use just the arguments, DICE will suggest a number of dice you could use.  The function will then return that number of dice.  A nice feature of DICE is that it can deal with numbers like 663, or numbers separated by commas.  For example, DICE(\"66,3\") will be 6, or 3 or just 63.  The function will also deal with negative numbers, fractions, and powers of 10."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What can I do to become a faster reader?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What can I do to become a faster reader?\n\nAssistant:One strategy that can help you become a faster reader is to focus on reading more-word-boundaries.  A word-boundary is a boundary around a word within a sentence, as shown in the diagram below.  By reading more word-boundaries, you\u2019ll be able to move faster through longer texts, since you\u2019ll be able to grasp the overall meaning and flow of the text more easily.  In addition to helping with speed, reading word-boundaries also has some other benefits, like improving your reading comprehension.  Do you want to work on reading word-boundaries in your own reading?  If you do, and you\u2019d like some guidance, I can help.  To read a sentence word-by-word, I\u2019d recommend looking at the left side of the diagram and reading as many word-boundaries as you can find.  (Try to find as many word-boundaries in a sentence as possible, especially in the first few words of the sentence.)  After you\u2019ve finished reading the sentence, read the next few words and repeat the process.  As you read longer sentences and paragraphs, you can do the same process, but focus on reading as many boundaries in each one as you can."}

You can teach these skills to your dog with the right kind of training, but you\u2019ll likely need to be there for every step of the way.  I have to warn you though, this will be a very different dog from one that you had originally purchased from a pet store.  Hunting is a highly specialized behavior, and dogs that are trained to hunt are usually very different in shape and temperament from the dogs you\u2019d get from a pet store."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: At what age is it most common for men who are genetically predisposed to start balding?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: At what age is it most common for men who are genetically predisposed to start balding?\n\nAssistant: The average male will start to lose their hair at around the age of 45, but this can vary by a few years due to factors such as genetics, hormones, and lifestyle.  At this point in life, many men begin to experience the first symptoms of hair loss, which are usually fine or thin hair on the crown of the head.  This usually progresses gradually over the next few years."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What does a flight attendant do?\n\nAssistant: You mean a flight attendant on an airplane?  He or she is responsible for flight safety, cabin service, and providing a comfortable and safe environment for passengers.  They generally work in teams of two to four people, who work eight hours per day, split up into \u201crotations\u201d so each person gets two off each day.  They also take emergency training classes, such as \u201cThe Four P\u2019s\u201d, which are Panic, Position, Passengers, and Plastics.  \u201cPassengers\u201d means ensuring that passengers aren\u2019t physically hurt, and that they\u2019re buckled into their seats safely; \u201cPlastics\u201d means that they make sure that the flotation equipment, such as life jackets, are nearby and ready for use.\n\nHuman: Do they need any special training?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What does a flight attendant do?\n\nAssistant: You mean a flight attendant on an airplane?

A flight attendant also needs to be able to operate an aircraft, so they often get some training in aircraft operation and maintenance.  Also, flight attendants are required to be able to communicate in different languages, since many people speak languages other than English, and sometimes flights are operated in other countries as well."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm going out to a party tonight, and they will be discussing renewable energy. What can you tell me?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re curious about energy.  Have you ever learned about the \u201crebound effect\u201d?\n\nHuman: I don't believe so.\n\nAssistant: That's when a person or organization reduces energy usage for a while and then increases it again. For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?  I\u2019m also guessing that energy from renewable sources is an important topic of the discussion?  I have a lot to say about this and could discuss it with you more, if you like.  Let me know if you\u2019d like to hear more.\n\nHuman: Please continue.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019ve read that there is a debate on whether the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.  For example, some people think that increasing investment in renewables causes emissions to rise as the amount of power they need to produce increases.  But others say that when renewable energy supplies more energy than is consumed, that energy is \u201cdischarged\u201d into the earth as heat. This means that it doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere\u2019s greenhouse gas levels.\n\nHuman: What do you think?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy. This leads to a rebound effect and the total consumption of energy increases. I\u2019m guessing the discussion tonight will be about whether the rebound effect is a bad thing or a good thing?  I\u2019m also guessing that energy from renewable sources is an important topic of the discussion?  I have a lot to say about this and could discuss it with you more, if you like.

I think it\u2019s important to consider the long-term effects of our actions, not just the short-term effects.  I think it\u2019s important to keep an eye on our planet and its resources, and take measures to protect them.  I\u2019m really interested in learning more about how we can use renewable energy sources to protect the planet and its resources.  I think it would be really interesting to talk more about this with you.  Would you be interested in hearing more about this topic?  I have a lot to say and I\u2019d really love to share it with you."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How did mankind discover that the earth was spherical, and why did they initially believe it to be flat?\n\nAssistant: Well, some of the earliest evidence for a round Earth comes from Greek philosophers who observed that sailors couldn\u2019t see the tip of the Earth as they sailed away from land.\n\nHuman: I've never heard of that anecdote.

Please just answer the quetsion.\n\nAssistant: I can tell you that many people believe that masturbation is a bad thing to do, because they see it as a sort of shortcut to sex.  Some people believe that they should only do it once a week, to avoid getting addicted.  However, there is not much scientific evidence to support these beliefs.  In fact, studies show that most men who smoke cigarettes for 20 or more years have higher rates of erectile dysfunction and other sexual problems, and in men who engage in masturbation regularly, these problems are less common.  And masturbation has only been studied for a short time, so it\u2019s hard to say what the long-term effects will be.  Also, some studies show that people who are more socially active and have more friends also masturbate less, so it\u2019s possible that these factors contribute to how often someone masturbates.\n\nIn terms of health, there isn\u2019t much scientific evidence to support the idea that masturbation causes problems with erections, orgasms, or other sexual functions.  But some studies do show that men who masturbate more often experience less mental and physical health.  So it seems that even though masturbation doesn\u2019t cause any health problems, it can be good to try to limit the frequency of masturbation, if it\u2019s causing problems with your sex life."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hey! I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products. Anything else?\n\nAssistant: There are also things you can do with your hair style, but I think these are on a different track than washing. You could try washing it a bit less, or combing it a bit more, or whatever you prefer. If you want to consider it, it can be hard to know if a hair style will help your hair or make it worse. What kinds of hair styles do you use?\n\nHuman: I have to have my hair up for work but otherwise I mostly wear it down\n\nAssistant: I would recommend you use a dry shampoo as well as a sulfate-free shampoo, and try to wash less frequently and spend more time conditioning your hair.

The chocolate chips or mini chocolate chips can be added right before you insert the oven and heat the mixture to 350 degrees F for about 15 minutes."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.  It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you\u2019ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).  However, the most painful way to do this is to yank the eyebrow hair out with tweezers.  This does not take very long, but it is incredibly painful.\n\nHuman: i'm looking for ways to make it less painful\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: how do i pluck my eyebrows without hurting?\n\nAssistant: The best way to minimize pain is to not pluck at all, as it will not grow back thicker and thicker until it\u2019s relatively painless to pluck.

One is to use very fine tweezers to remove as much of the hair as possible, without very very very fine tweezers you could pull the hair out very quickly and painfully, and very very very fine tweezers don\u2019t even feel like they\u2019re touching the hair!  Another is to use extremely fine scissors to cut off the hair, as the scissors will be much closer to your skin than the tweezers will be, and you may be able to pull the hair out more easily with scissors.  You could also try using your fingers to scrape off some of the hair, rather than using tweezers."}

I have some advice for you:  Try to remember that while it\u2019s good to be aware of how you appear to others, it\u2019s even more important to feel good about yourself and your own relationship with food. If you feel good about eating and being at the table, it will show in your behavior and you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being self-centered. So take pride in your food choices and be proud of how you eat, and others will be amazed by your manners."}

Many programming languages, including C, include more advanced features like loops and conditions, and I think you\u2019ll find the extra information in those sections helpful.\n\nHuman: Okay thanks. And can you tell me about how loops are used?\n\nAssistant: Of course!  Loops are used to repeat a section of code multiple times.  In C, there are three types of loops: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop.  I\u2019ll go through each of them briefly.  \n\nThe \"for\" loop is used to repeat a section of code a specific number of times.  The syntax is as follows:\n\nfor (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {\n    // code to be executed // \n}\n\nThe initialization is run once at the beginning of the loop.  The condition is checked at the beginning of each loop, and if it evaluates to true, the loop continues.  The increment/decrement is run at the end of each loop, after the code inside the loop has been executed once.  \n\nThe \"while\" loop is used to repeat a section of code as long as a certain condition is true.  The syntax is as follows:\n\nwhile (condition) {\n    // code to be executed\n}\n\nThe condition is checked at the beginning of each loop.  If it is true, the code inside the loop is executed.  Once the code inside the loop has been executed, the condition is checked again, and if it is still true, the loop continues.  If the condition is false from the start, the loop ends and the program continues with the next line of code after the loop.  \n\nThe \"do-while\" loop is similar to the while loop, but the code inside the loop is executed first, and then the condition is checked.  The condition is checked first because the code inside the loop is always executed at least once, even if the condition is false from the start.  \nI hope that helps!  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: It seems like people are so divided by politics nowdays, has it always been this bad?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not easy to understand the history of political divisions in our country, since there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and oppression in the past, but I do want to try.  Let\u2019s start with the Civil War.  This war was a time of increasing division between the North and South in the U.S., as each side disagreed over some of the most fundamental issues of the time.  So did the Civil War begin as a disagreement between slave-holders and abolitionists?\n\nHuman: Or maybe it was about culture differences?\n\nAssistant: Actually, when the Civil War began, about half of the US people didn\u2019t own any slaves.  The conflict was caused by a different issue -- the idea that some people had more power than others.  And that\u2019s why so many people from the South migrated to the West, so they could keep their sense of autonomy and equality.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That kind of adds to the theory.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: It seems like people are so divided by politics nowdays, has it always been this bad?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not easy to understand the history of political divisions in our country, since there\u2019s been a lot of fighting and oppression in the past, but I do want to try.

The South wanted to return to the way things were before the war, with a system of white political power and a system of racial segregation.  The North wanted to rebuild the Southern states, with equality for all.  But the people of the South didn\u2019t want change.  So who were the politicians to choose between the North and the South?  It became a battle for power, with each side fighting for its own interests.  But in the end, the Constitution won out.  This is what the Constitution looks like, with the five independent states joined together by a single president.  This document is the foundation of our democracy.  So now you know more about when our country was formed, and what really divided us."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain the difference between a solar and lunar eclipse\n\nAssistant: Well, a solar eclipse happens when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth.  This means it blocks all sunlight from reaching the Earth.  So the Earth is in complete darkness, and some parts of the world experience \u201ctotality\u201d.  A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, so that the Earth blocks the sunlight shining on the moon.  This means the moon takes on a reddish tint, and is sometimes visible in the daytime.  Lunar eclipses happen only when the moon is at a full moon.\n\nHuman: Wow, very interesting!

Solar eclipses happen when the moon is between the sun and the earth, often at the same time each month.  They are a much more dramatic event, with the entire earth being darkened by the moon's shadow.  I hope you get to see one some time!"}

It might help to talk about your feelings with a therapist, or a friend.  Sometimes just being around someone who won't judge you for your feelings can be really helpful.

This allows the phones to recognize each other, and also allows phone numbers to be linked to a specific sim card.  In some phones, the serial number is also used to encrypt data that is sent between the phones."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What bands would I like if I like Simon and Garfunkel?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty tricky to answer that kind of question, because there\u2019s no obvious way to characterize what it is about Simon and Garfunkel that you like. You probably like something about the harmonies, the acoustic guitars, or maybe the lyrics, but I\u2019m not sure which. Is there some music you like that has similar elements?\n\nHuman: What are some similar artists?\n\nAssistant: Well, you mentioned Simon and Garfunkel, but also bands like the Beatles, the Monkees, the Beach Boys, the Cowsills, Crosby, Stills and Nash, the Mamas and the Papas, and Simon and Garfunkel themselves.\n\nHuman: What other bands would I like?\n\nAssistant: Are you looking for people who have the same harmonies and sounds, or a similar type of songwriting, or is it just about the singers?  Are you looking for different instruments, or maybe you\u2019re just interested in bands that sound like what Simon and Garfunkel would sound like if they made different music?\n\nHuman: Yes, what is a Crosby Stills and Nash song I should look up?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: What bands would I like if I like Simon and Garfunkel?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s pretty tricky to answer that kind of question, because there\u2019s no obvious way to characterize what it is about Simon and Garfunkel that you like.

One thing I noticed about \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" is that it has a nice, simple, three-note rhythm that\u2019s based on the chords \"C\" and \"G\" and \"A\", and the melody is based on the notes \"C\" and \"G\".  I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what you were looking for.  If you\u2019re interested in the harmonies, you might find this song particularly satisfying because it has two-part harmonies that sound very similar to what Simon and Garfunkel were known for."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you get rid of water weight?\n\nAssistant: Maybe the following can help.  Hydration is a water balance in the body that is related to metabolism, body fluid, electrolyte levels, and renal function.  So, that depends on a variety of factors, but you can take measures to keep electrolytes balanced, keep hydration from being imbalanced, keep sodium levels up and keep potassium levels up, and/or keep the levels of minerals in your diet in a reasonable range.  You can also eat healthy meals and snacks, and keep your urine looking nice and dark and easy to see in the toilet.  Washing your face regularly with a wet paper towel will help remove extra sodium, and maybe using an eye dropper for face washing as well.\n\nHuman: Why do you keep your sodium up? Why should you urine be dark?\n\nAssistant: If the sodium level is too high, it could end up causing renal issues.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is Pizza ai frutti di mare?\n\nAssistant: Pizza ai frutti di mare, the literal translation from Italian, is pizza with fruits of the sea, or, more colloquially, seafood pizza. But you might just say pizza.\n\nHuman: Oh okay. What are some other traditional Italian pizzas?\n\nAssistant: Well, some people might call them calzones, but these are similar to pizza:  The standard Neapolitan pizza is with tomato sauce, cheese, and usually oregano, so that\u2019s a pretty typical pizza.

It\u2019s pretty easy to make.  All you need are cheese, potatoes, and some flour.  So let\u2019s say you have four potatoes and you want to make four Sfincione.  First you wash the potatoes and cut them into pieces.  Then you put the potatoes in a pot of water and cover it.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer for about ten minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through.  Drain the water, then add the flour and mix well with a spoon.  Then add the potatoes, and mix again.  You now have a dough!  Roll it out on a floured surface to the thickness of a pizza pan, or whatever large surface you want to make a pizza on.  And that\u2019s it!  You can add other ingredients to it, if you like, like tomatoes or basil.  Just cut it into slices and bake in the oven at 180C / 350F for about ten to\u5341\u4e94 minutes, or until golden brown."}

However, I can tell you that tree frog eggs are commonly found in the nests of Monarch butterflies, which are native to North America and migrate long distances every year.  So you could try putting some tiny bottle caps into your garden's birdbaths to trick the Monarchs into taking their eggs.  You could also put some sugar water in a small plastic container and place it in your tree's nest of tree frogs, to see if any Monarch eggs hatch.  I hope this helps!"}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it? Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.

Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant: I'd recommend an indoor lifestyle for a rat, though you can get some kinds of rats that are just small enough to be handled indoors (the smallest rats are around 2-3 inches long), so you could have a small pet rat.  I'd recommend a container that's around 10-12 inches wide and 8-10 inches high, and the rat can get into it and stay inside, which would be it's enclosure.  You'll need to provide a bed for it inside as well, in case it gets cold.  You can find all kinds of information about how to raise a pet rat on the internet, and it should be pretty easy to take care of with a bit of research.  If you do go this route, you'll want to feed them hay, as that's what they're supposed to eat, and you'll also want to clean it and the container often.  Some people even buy special food for their rats, but that can be expensive.  You should clean the container and the bed frequently as well.  I recommend cleaning the container at least once a week and the bed once a week as well.  I'd recommend giving them baths as well, which you can do by dipping them in water and then swiping them dry with a towel.  This will help get rid of any dirt or hair that may accumulated over the week."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\n\nAssistant: Autumn is a part of the seasonal change that is caused by the earth moving from its summer position to its winter position in its orbit around the sun.  The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information. Do you have any articles you can provide or links that explain this further?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here\u2019s a great article that explains more about the causes of the autumn leaves changing color: https://www.kidzworld.com/article/autumn-leaves-colors\n\nHuman: That link isn't working for me\n\nAssistant:", "response": " This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.

If you choose to drink coffee or caffeinated beverages, I would recommend that you do so in moderation.  One cup of decaf.  One coffee or tea with lunch, or one small candy bar.  These are all reasonable amounts for most people.  If you drink more than this often, you may find that you get jittery or anxious, and this can be a problem at work or in social situations.  Try to keep your caffeine intake to one or two drinks per day, and also try to get your rest and exercise regularly.  And if you are ever feeling really nervous or anxious, maybe it\u2019s time to talk to a doctor or therapist to see if there may be an underlying problem.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I fix a leaky faucet?\n\nAssistant: Is it possible that you have a blockage in the pipes, and therefore need a plumber?  Can you tell me more about what exactly is leaking?\n\nHuman: The faucet is just dripping from where water normally comes out, even when the handle is completely off. It's not a ton of water, it's just a slow drip, a drop or two every few seconds.\n\nAssistant: That sounds like there is a drip from the pipes somewhere.  I'm guessing this is probably a plumbing issue?\n\nHuman: Well I don't see any water leaking from the pipes going into the walls that connect to the faucet, but anyway, what can I do?\n\nAssistant: Have you tried shutting off the water to the faucet entirely?\n\nHuman: Yes, if I shut off the valve it stops working entirely and there's no more dripping. But I'd like to be able to use the faucet without shutting the valve on and off every time..\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I fix a leaky faucet?\n\nAssistant: Is it possible that you have a blockage in the pipes, and therefore need a plumber?

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am getting a new phone. Is 5g better than 4g?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t have a very deep understanding of mobile telecommunications technology, but if you\u2019re asking about 4G vs 5G as it relates to phone networks, the consensus seems to be that 5G is better than 4G.  It\u2019s just the same thing as asking if you prefer apples or oranges.  5G has a shorter name than 4G, so that\u2019s part of why people call it 5G, but that\u2019s also related to marketing, and I don\u2019t know if there are really meaningful differences between the actual technologies.\n\nHuman: I think it is supposed to be a lot faster.\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I am getting a new phone.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's a good way to sharpen my kitchen knives?\n\nAssistant: There's a couple things I think you should know.  First, the kitchen knives are not actually sharp.  They are dull.  Second, using the kitchen knives to sharpen kitchen knives is unsafe.  To safely sharpen kitchen knives, you should use a sharpening stone or a whetstone or a metal rod.

I can tell you that using a metal rod or stone is much safer than using a kitchen knife because it won't cause you serious harm if you mishandle it.  A kitchen knife will be very difficult to control with a metal rod or stone.  And even if you are careful, a metal rod or stone will still be very hard to control, so it's still unsafe to use a kitchen knife with one.  I recommend that you don't do this.

You can also perform this procedure during the day when they are more likely to be out.  If you do this, be sure to have a bucket or container ready to catch any dead cockroaches that fall into it.  It is best to do this outside, as cockroaches are very poisonous and contain hydrogen cyanide.  \n\nThere are also other home remedies that I can think of that are less well-known, but I\u2019m not sure if any of them will work.

The doctors and nurses are all experts in infectious diseases and they try to keep the isolation wards filled with patients who can be helped.  The patients in the quarantine area are often strange and bizarre, and there are sometimes encounters with zombies that are not terribly predictable.  The plot often involves the hospital trying to prevent a zombie breakout in the community, and the doctors and nurses have to work together to protect themselves and their patients from the\u50f5\u5c38\u75c5\u6bd2."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time. What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you! Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like.

Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant: The water temperature you use will have an impact on whether the water removes dirt and stains, and on how clean the clothes end up.  Most people seem to agree that the best water temperature is about 100 \u00b0F, but there are a few different opinions about which one is best for different types of fabric and dirt.  Most people seem to agree that the water should be quite warm, just above your skin, not hot.  I can help you figure this out by asking you some questions."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I teach my kids to speak French?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I teach my kids to speak French?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a great idea to expose your children to the sounds of the French language as early as possible.  You could read to them in French, or just speak French to them whenever you can.  You could even play a French language video game together.  The more exposure your children get to the sounds of the French language, the easier it will be for them to learn the language when they get to a more formal stage."}

What's the best way to go about it?\n\nAssistant: It is a very serious decision and I'm very sorry to hear that you're thinking about breaking up with your girlfriend.  My first suggestion is that you talk to her and try to understand what her motivations are for wanting to end the relationship.  If she is really, truly unhappy in the relationship, it may be possible to salvage things.  But if she is not really unhappy, but is withholding affection in order to hurt you, then I would strongly recommend breaking up with her."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My twins hate each other. What can I do?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: My twins hate each other. What can I do?\n\nAssistant: It can be very difficult to fix a hate relationship, especially when the two people involved are very young.  However, you can help by doing everything you can to minimize the conflict, and protect your twins from hurting each other.  You can try the following:\n\nTry to understand what is causing the conflict.  Is it that one child is more dominant and jealous of the other child?  Is one more outgoing and confident and the other more shy and insecure?  Is one more caring and nurturing and the other more critical and harsh?  Is one more responsible and disciplined and the other more reckless and impulsive?  Is one more careful and careful of their body and mind and the other more reckless and careless of their body and mind?  Is one more loving and kind and the other more angry and violent?  It sounds like there are a number of possible causes.  For example, you could say that one child is jealous of the other child when the other is spending more time playing with their favorite toy.  Or, it might be that one child is more nurturing and protective and the other is more critical and harsh.  A child is more likely to be critical and harsh if the other child is spending too much time around their favorite toys and activities.  Or, if one child is more caring and nurturing, then it is more likely that the other child is being reckless and careless.  A child is more likely to be reckless and careless if the other child is spending too much time playing with their favorite toys and activities.  Or, if one child is responsible and disciplined, then it is more likely that the other child is more reckless and careless.  A child is more likely to be reckless and careless if the other child is spending too much time playing with their favorite toys and activities.  Or, if one child is more careful and careful of their body and mind, then it is more likely that the other child is more reckless and careless of their body and mind.  A child is more likely to be reckless and careless of their body and mind if the other child is spending too much time playing with their favorite toys and activities.  Or, if one child is more loving and kind, then it is more likely that the other child is more angry and violent.  A child is more likely to be angry and violent if the other child is spending too much time playing with their favorite toys and activities.  It can also be helpful to understand what is happening emotionally.  Both children likely feel some level of rejection and unhappiness when they spend time together.  It can also be helpful to understand what is happening physically.  If one child is jealous of the other child, and the other child is spending too much time around their favorite toys, then they may be spending time playing in the same room, which is preventing one child from interacting with their favorite toy.  If both children are spending time together in the same room, then they might be fighting.  If one child is nurturing and the other is critical and harsh, then it may be that they are fighting over the same activity or toy.  When children are fighting, they feel rejection and unhappiness.  Sometimes fighting can be the result of one child being jealous of the other child.  It can also be helpful to understand how the children interact with each other when they are living together in the same room.  Do they tend to share toys and activities with each other?  When they don\u2019t share, does one child tend to push the other child away?  If one child tends to push the other child away, then it may be that one of them feels rejected and unhappy when they aren\u2019t sharing toys and activities.  What if children are fighting and crying and you are trying to comfort them?  You may want to ask them what is happening and why they are fighting.  They can tell you that they are fighting because one of them feels rejected and unhappy when the other isn\u2019t sharing toys and activities.  You can then help them to understand how they can feel better by sharing toys and activities with each other.  You can say that it is important to share toys and activities so that one child doesn\u2019t feel rejected and unhappy when the other isn\u2019t sharing.  You can say that it would be better for one child to share toys and activities with the other child because it helps them to feel better when they are sharing.  When you interact with your children, try to be as loving and kind as possible.  You can say that it is important to be loving and kind to your children.  You can say that it is important to be kind to each other because it helps you feel better.  You can say that it is easier to feel happy and less angry when you are kind to each other.  You can say that it is easier to feel happy and less angry when you are sharing toys and activities with each other.  You can say that it is easier to feel happy and less angry when you are nice to each other and consider each other\u2019s feelings.  It can also be helpful to talk with your children about why they are feeling the way that they are feeling.  Can you tell them that they both feel upset when they are fighting?  They can say that they feel upset when they are fighting.  You can say that it would be better for them to be fighting when they are not feeling upset.  They can say that it would be better for them to not feel upset if they were sharing toys and activities with each other.  You can say that it would be better for them to share toys and activities with each other if they were feeling better.  You can say that if one of them feels better when they are sharing, then they will be more able to share toys and activities with the other child.  It can also be helpful to ask your children if it is okay for them to play together.  When they say that they would like to play together, you can say that it will be nice for them to play together.  You can say that it is good for them to play together because it helps them to feel happier.  You can say that it is better for them to play together because it helps them to feel happier.  You can say that it will be nice for them to play together because it makes them feel happier.  You can say that it is good for them to play together, and then you can ask them to play together.  You can ask them to play with each other for as long as they want.  If they say that they want to play for a while, then you can ask them to stop playing when they are ready.  You can say that it will be nice for them to play together for as long as they want.  You can say that they should stop playing when they are ready.  You can say that it would be nice for them to play together for as long as they want.  You can say that they should stop playing when they are ready.  You can ask them to play with each other for as long as they want.  If they say that they want to play for a while, then you can ask them to stop playing when they are ready."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I care for an iguana?\n\nAssistant: Iguanas are lizards, and they\u2019re a lot like tortoises in the way they\u2019re easy to take care of. You don\u2019t need to do anything special, just make sure they have some food and water, and make sure they\u2019re in a safe, clean cage or enclosure.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How is oil turned into gasoline?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How is oil turned into gasoline?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  Oil is changed into gas by a process called \"distillation\".  In this process, oil is first heated until it \"cracks\", or separates into its component elements:  hydrogen and oxygen.  The hydrogen can then be \"compressed\" and \"drained\" of the oil, leaving behind just the oxygen.  The oxygen is turned into gas, which is then sold to consumers as \"gasoline\".  The process is very efficient and produces very little waste!"}

This is normal and will probably get better on its own once your bicycle is out of storage for the winter.  You could try lubricating it with a few drops of oil to help reduce the noise."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do sharks have tongues?\n\nAssistant: This is a very important question. The first thing to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue. But the most important type are the cartilaginous, or skate, sharks, which do have a tongue.\n\nHuman: It seems like they would cut their tongues on all those teeth.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it seems very strange that sharks would have a long, flexible tongue, and not cut it on their teeth. It\u2019s almost like they would have a tongue just for... well, something else. Do you think sharks have a special reason to have a tongue?\n\nHuman: I would think it evolved for some reason or other?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think so. There are actually some really good reasons to not have a tongue. A tongue is just a muscle that you\u2019d have to maintain. It takes energy to eat and digest food, and food takes energy to produce. And when sharks are hunting for food they need their energy to swim and go after it. If they had tongues they\u2019d waste a lot of energy in unnecessary muscle activity. They\u2019d probably have to give up on hunting so that they could make their tongues work. But a skate shark has a tongue, and we need to figure out why.\n\nHuman: Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " to know is that there are a lot of different types of sharks. Most are without a tongue.

A tongue is made of cartilage, not bone, so it wouldn\u2019t last very long in a shark attack. This doesn\u2019t mean that sharks don\u2019t hurt their tongues, they just can\u2019t kill them. Sharks lose their tongues very quickly, and often their whole tongues are cut off, so it\u2019s very important not to get one of their tongues. But it\u2019s good to know that there are lots of different types of sharks, and that they\u2019re all pretty good at eating."}

So the distance from new york to california is called the \"travel distance\" from new york to california.  I'm not sure how you'd calculate this, but you could ask a computer to do it for you.

The only way to be sure people in the community are able to reduce their own risk of infection is for everyone to wear a mask.\n\nHuman: Why did our ex-president make it into a pissing contest to wear a mask or not\n\nAssistant: That was a very unfavorable and negative situation for our country.  During his presidency, Covid became more widespread, and our government was unable to provide adequate support for people who needed help preventing the spread of Covid.   Many people feel that our government failed them, and that\u2019s a very sad situation.  We should all try to remember what went wrong, and learn from it."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?  What is the difference between the two houses?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the different responsibilities. The House of Representatives has more power over national and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.  Another difference is that the House has 435 representatives elected every two years, and the Senate has 100 members.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the House of Representatives (435 representatives)?\n\nAssistant: The founders of the United States of America had a concern about the possibility of corruption in government.  They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.  The idea was that if the House of Representatives was too large, people would be less interested in voting in the elections.  The founders did not want to make the House of Representatives too small, because then there would be too little diversity among the representatives and no states would be represented adequately.\n\nHuman: How was the number of representatives determined for the Senate (100 representatives)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " and local affairs, and the Senate has more power over foreign affairs and states\u2019 rights.

Each state was given a number of representatives in the Senate that was equal to the number of senators that state had in the House of Representatives.  Senators were appointed to the Senate by the president and the members were elected by the state voters every two years.  The number of representatives in the Senate was set at 100 so that each state would have an equal number of representatives in the Senate and so that there would be no one state that had more representatives in the Senate than any other state.  The idea was that each state would have an equal say in the government and no state would have too many representatives to be overpowered by the others."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: It is my first winter in my new home and I am getting ready to winterize it. What steps do I need to take to make sure that my new home is not damaged by the cold weather and snow?\n\nAssistant: Good question!  To prevent damage to your home, make sure to close and secure all windows, and doors.  This is essential for keeping out the cold weather, so you can stay warm and cozy inside!  \nOtherwise, winter weather is often a great time to stay inside and relax, as well as avoid unnecessary risks like slipping on the icy roads.\n\nHuman: Okay that makes sense.

I have heard that can be a problem.\n\nAssistant: You are wise to think ahead, and you\u2019re right that freezing water pipes can be a hazard!  To protect against that, first check to see if your home is already winterized -  you will want to make sure to turn your main water valve completely off, and then ensure any other outdoor water sources are turned off as well.\n\nHuman: I am pretty sur the home is not winterized.

One way to do this is to use a heated blanket or pad to protect the pipes, but be careful not to overheat the house, as this can be dangerous.

Cashews taste great, but others might be better.\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of factors to consider when it comes to which nuts are the most healthful.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I feel more energetic throughout the day?\n\nAssistant: There are lots of reasons we might feel less energetic throughout the day, but the ones that seem most important to me are:\n\n-some nutrients and fluids in our diet that we\u2019re not getting, either because they\u2019re not in the food we eat or because we\u2019re not eating often enough\n-or a lot of exercise.\n\nHuman: What else can I do?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I feel more energetic throughout the day?\n\nAssistant: There are lots of reasons we might feel less energetic throughout the day, but the ones that seem most important to me are:\n\n-some nutrients and fluids in our diet that we\u2019re not getting, either because they\u2019re not in the food we eat or because we\u2019re not eating often enough\n-or a lot of exercise.\n\nHuman: What else can I do?\n\nAssistant: If the reasons for less energy are due to the food you\u2019re eating, you might want to consider if there are any specific nutrients you\u2019re lacking.  For example, calcium is important for bone growth, and calcium is found in dairy products, leafy vegetables, and other foods.  If you\u2019re not getting enough calcium in your diet, you may feel tired.  You can test your calcium level with a simple blood test.  Or you can take a calcium supplement.  The easiest way to test your calcium level is to boil a few ounces of water, add a couple tablespoons of calcium carbonate and let it sit for a few minutes.  You can then pour the liquid into a cup and use a thermometer to measure the amount of calcium that was added.  Then you can add a little bit of vinegar to the water to neutralize the calcium carbonate and test the amount of calcium that was converted to calcium by the vinegar.  If the test says that you have enough calcium in your diet to satisfy the test, you probably don\u2019t need a supplement.  But if the test says that you don\u2019t have enough calcium in your diet, you should consider taking a supplement.  You can also check your sodium level.  High sodium levels in our blood can make us feel tired.  Sodium is found in many foods, especially processed foods and fast food.  So eating more vegetables and fruits, especially ones that are low in sodium, can help bring your sodium levels down.  You can test your sodium level with a simple blood test, too.   But we still need to check your calcium level and your sodium level.  Are you getting enough calcium in your diet and does your sodium level seem OK?  \nIf the reasons for less energy are due to exercise, you might want to consider how much exercise you\u2019re getting and how long it is.  We all need some exercise to be healthy, but we don\u2019t all get the same amount of exercise.  If your energy is low, you might want to consider how much exercise you\u2019re getting.  Do you have time for a proper exercise routine?  If you do have time for exercise, you could also try doing some cardio exercise, which is any type of exercise that gets your heart rate up, such as running or cycling.  These types of exercises are best for your heart, but also help you feel more energetic."}

It has to do with males hooking up w/ males or females hooking up with females. Are there animals that do that?\n\nAssistant: A lot of animals have pretty open sexualities, I guess?  It\u2019s not like they just mate for life with the same partner and live their lives as a unit.  There are some monogamous animals, but most animals that aren\u2019t just mating to procreate or reproduce or whatnot.  Some insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.  I guess there aren\u2019t many studies about that because most animals are pretty secretive about their sexual lives.  It\u2019s really hard to tell what any of them are doing with each other.  \nBut I think there are a lot of gay people in the animal kingdom.  Gay people are just like anyone else, they don\u2019t want to be alone, and they want to love and have affection.  If you think of gay humans as a different kind of person than straight people, then all of the animals that aren\u2019t having sex to reproduce must be gay people.  That\u2019s all there is to it, really.\n\nHuman: A lot of animals mate for life, like a lot of birds.\n\nAssistant: I guess it\u2019s the same for birds too.  Birds live in groups, so maybe some of them are gay, but some are monogamous, because they have a one-on-one relationship.  \nSome birds raise their babies together, like with the meerkats and crows and magpies.  Maybe they\u2019re bisexual?\n\nHuman: What would living in groups have to do with sexuality?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " insects and lizards and fish have a lot of what we\u2019d call a casual sex life.  \nI don\u2019t really know about the other animals though.

It\u2019s like if I lived in a group of guys who only got together for the male bonding.  But most of the guys were male bonding, and the ones that were gay or bisexual were the ones that were together for the ladies\u2019\u4ea4\u4f1a\u3002  Like the ladies\u2019\u4ea4\u4f1a\u3002  But I guess the same thing would happen with birds.  I don\u2019t really know.  I just know that a lot of birds form close bonds with each other, so it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re gay or bisexual."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question! You\u2019ll have a lot of different skin problems, including acne, wrinkles, age spots, and others.  It really depends on what you want to improve.  There\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t know exactly the right answer to your question, but I might know some of the big issues.  Let me start with two basics:\n\n1. Your skin needs certain things from you to stay healthy, and these include a regular routine for washing and using other things on it.  I can help you get started on a basic skin routine, if you like.\n\n2. Your skin is mostly home to bacteria, and you need to be aware of that.  Some of these bacteria, like Staphylococcus, can be particularly annoying, but usually the whole issue of balancing bacteria and skin gets a lot of press only if there are concerns about skin infections.  It\u2019s really not that hard to keep the bacteria under control.\n\nSo that\u2019s an introduction, now to the specifics of your question:\n\nKeeping the skin healthy -- and I\u2019m using the word \u201chealthy\u201d to mean \u201cable to do its functions well\u201d -- can mean quite a few different things.\n\nHuman: Okay, any other ideas?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " I keep my skin healthy?\n\nAssistant: Great question!

There are a lot of different factors that can influence skin health, like diet, temperature, how much you exercise, and so on.  It\u2019s also really important to choose products that your skin likes and can use, since some people have reactions to certain ingredients.  Do you want to know more about what kinds of products are suitable for your skin?  Maybe we can look at some of the ingredients you use and see what they might be.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hi, Assistant!\n\nAssistant: Hello, Human!  Do you have a question?\n\nHuman: Yes. I may make a candle and need to know what equipment or tools I need including materials\n\nAssistant: Can you tell me more about what you're trying to do, and what materials you think you might need?

How large is the candle?\n\nHuman: Not that big. But can we get to listing the equipment or tools needed and the material. Like I said, I already know I need wax and wick\n\nAssistant: Of course!  The equipment or tools you'll need are a container to hold the wax and wick, such as a glass bowl or container, and a heat source, such as a burner or a candle lighter.  The wax you use is wax, which can be made from any type of petroleum product, such as paraffin or petroleum jelly.  The wick you use is a small piece of fiber that is either made of paper or cotton, or sometimes glass, which you put into the wax to give it light.  You can use any type of wax, so long as it's the right strength, and you can use any wick, so long as it's the right width.  Different types of wax and wick will result in different types of candles.  For example, lotus wax and a short wick will result in a lotus candle, and beeswax and a long wick will result in a beehive candle.  I'm happy to help you choose the right type of candle for your needs."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: My daughter is reading the book \"Lord of the Flies.\" Can you tell me what the book is about and any important details about the story I should know so we can have a thoughtful discussion.\n\nAssistant: The story is a parable of what happens when groups of humans behave badly. It\u2019s a cautionary tale that human nature is flawed, and that you can\u2019t depend on civilized morality to keep everyone in check. And it's not a happy story.\n\nHuman: Doesn't sound happy.\n\nAssistant: It's not. It's set in a school class that was evacuated during a war. The boys are left on their own on an island, and a group of them kills the two leaders. From there, the book follows them as they try to find food and build shelter. One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him. The thing that I'll be remembering about the book is a scene where one of the main characters describes a \"perfect island\", an island that would be so perfect it would be \"like a jewel of white quartz\" because it would be completely without flaw, and it could have no room for evil or pain or suffering. And he realizes how good it sounds, but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum. What is it the schools want the students to learn from the book?\n\nAssistant: It's a book that explores human nature, and that one of the things we humans have is an instinct to want to be told what to do, because we want to feel safe and comfortable. The theme is that people need to take responsibility for themselves, and not rely on a few leaders to tell them what to do. So I guess it's a book that talks about morality in a religious and ethical way. It's kind of a warning about the danger of human nature, but it's also a cautionary tale about what humans could do, if they're not careful.\n\nHuman: Sounds a little frightening to think about it.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it can be a bit scary, that's true. In the end the boys \"eat one another\" and then there's a bit that's just descriptions of a few individuals and their names. It's not really scary, just very dark.\n\nHuman: I'm sure my daughter will have loads of questions. She has an insatiable curiosity.\n\nAssistant:", "response": " but that it would be \"impossible to find it,\" and the human race couldn't survive on a place like that.\n\nHuman: This book is wildly popular in the school curriculum.

I'm sure your daughter will want to talk to you about it and you'll be happy to talk to her and explain.  I think what the book is trying to say is that if humans aren't careful they can lose their way and go very wrong. But I'm sure your daughter will be able to grapple with that idea and understand it. I think the best way for her to understand it is through your explanations and discussions with her. I think that's what parents are for, to help their children understand the world and their place in it. I hope you and your daughter have a great time talking about it."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: Wearing cotton makes me curious, how is it harvested?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a great question!  In order to harvest cotton, it needs to be grown.  When the plant is large and strong, it is generally chosen to be harvested.  The seeds are collected by hand and the cotton is sorted by quality and quantity.  Sometimes a fraction of the cotton is left on the plant to grow into the next crop, this is called the \u201cstalk\u201d or \u201chead\u201d cotton."}

They will both work well on most types of wood.  You can also use a turpentine or mineral oil as a finish, but be very careful not to dilute it with water.  A common mistake is to mix it with solvents, like acetone, which will actually strip the wood of its protective oils and cause it to fade and deteriorate over time."}

Let me tell you a little about how we do budgeting in our office.  We have a fixed salary and a part-cost of living index that we use to determine how much we spend.  We try to spend no more than this, and we track our spending each month to make sure we\u2019re sticking to it.  Here\u2019s a screenshot of our budget, which you can find in the document archive on our website.  We\u2019ve marked the areas that are important to you, and we\u2019ve put a check next to each amount to indicate how much we typically spend in that area.  We\u2019ve also added a little box next to each item to indicate how much we plan to spend.  We think this helps a lot when we compare our spending to our budget, so it\u2019s always good to check.  We want to make sure that we\u2019re sticking to our budget, and we try to do this by tracking our spending.  We\u2019ve had some success at this, and we like to see that our spending is staying under our budget, rather than going over it.  If you want to learn more about budgeting, just let me know, and I\u2019ll be happy to explain it to you, and show you some screenshots of our budget."}

But first we will talk about the meaning of the word \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d.\n\nHuman: Okay.\n\nAssistant: A cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that is used only on a digital platform. It is not stored in a physical place on a bank\u2019s server. You can store it in your computer or on other devices. The cryptocurrency is created and circulated through a blockchain technology. This technology is used to track the history of the cryptocurrency and to verify who created it and who holds it. There are several types of cryptocurrencies, but some of the most important ones are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. \n\nWe will talk about Bitcoin first. It is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrencies. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people called \u201cthe miners\u201d. They believed that Bitcoin would be a powerful means of payment that could replace traditional currencies. However, after 2015, the value of Bitcoin increased very fast, but then it started to decrease. This is because there were many people hoping to get rich by trading cryptocurrencies, and there were also many companies that promised to make money by helping people trade cryptocurrencies. \n\nNow we will talk about Ethereum. It was created in 2014 by an anonymous person or group of people called \u201cthe developers\u201d and it was named after the creator of the programming language \u201cEthereum\u201d. The developers wanted to create a platform that could run their own cryptocurrency, called \u201cEthereum\u201d. Ethereum is a much bigger platform than Bitcoin and it includes its own programming language, smart contracts, a cryptocurrency called \u201c Ether\u201d and a token called \u201c ETH\u201d. \n\nWe will say more about Ethereum later in this conversation, but for now I would like to recommend that you learn more about Bitcoin. It is really easy to start investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin. You can do this using an app on your smartphone. The app will show you the current market value of each cryptocurrency and it will also tell you how much Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin you can expect to get back if you sell them in the future. These values are called \u201cprices\u201d and the app will show you them on a graph. There are also many online resources that explain the basics of cryptocurrencies and also give advice on which is the best to invest in."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Tell me what the easiest language to learn is.\n\nAssistant: Programming languages.  They\u2019re really designed to be flexible and allow you to model anything you want to program, but they\u2019re also pretty easy to understand.\n\nHuman: I am not good at programming languages. It is really difficult. Are there easier languages? I hear that there are easier languages than programming languages.\n\nAssistant: There are plenty of simpler programming languages, but I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ceasier\u201d.  Programming languages are really just high-level languages that compile down to binary machine code, and in most cases we could talk about \u201cbinary languages\u201d that are simpler, but the tradeoffs are that they are harder to write, and harder to debug.  Python is a \u201chigh-level language\u201d that compiles to C.

For me\uff0cthe easiest language to learn is Java.  It\u2019s not quite as easy as Python, but it has a good syntax and a large standard library, and it\u2019s useful for a lot of things.  One downside is that it\u2019s a little more difficult to read than Python, but most of the time you won\u2019t need to read the code very much.  And most of the time you won\u2019t need to write it.  Once you\u2019ve written it, it\u2019s fast and can do a lot of interesting things."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: Draining a cyst can be difficult, because it\u2019s filled with fluid. It may feel like a mass or lump under your skin. It can grow for many years. Cysts that have been there for a long time may be filled with dead cells, which makes it harder for the doctor to remove them. Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst. If it\u2019s a very small cyst, you can probably just do the following:\n\n  1. If possible, use an unopened, sterile syringe, available from a pharmacy.\n  2. Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4. Clean the area around your cyst and around your needle with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial hand cleanser.\n  5. Use your finger to gently press the cyst outward. This may take some time. It may be necessary to poke at the cyst with the needle to force it to pop out of the skin.\n  6. Wipe off the area.\n  7. If you still see fluid in your needle, carefully use a new needle.\n  8. Slowly inject the fluid from your needle into the rubber cap of a clean, empty bottle.\n  9. Save the fluid.\n\nHuman: Thanks so much for this information!\n\nAssistant:", "response": " for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst.

I can tell you that the Triangulum galaxy is currently being observed to be rotating very rapidly, sometimes called the \"tidal deceleration of Triangulum\".  There is some debate among astronomers whether this is natural or caused by the actions of some intelligent beings, but I personally believe it is caused by some massive and extremely powerful force, and that there is no reason to believe that this is just random motion."}

Also, some fruits and vegetables, such as grapes, pineapples, and citrus fruits, contain sugars that can cause dental problems for dogs.  Foods that are not safe for all dogs to eat include shellfish, particularly krill, because some dogs are allergic to their protein.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I heard that Potbelly pigs make great pets and I'm thinking about getting one. Are they good pets?\n\nAssistant: Potbelly pigs are omnivores and love to be around people, but they need proper stimulation and playtime to keep them healthy.  As far as pet intelligence goes, it's similar to that of a dog or cat.  Potbelly pigs are good social animals, but they do tend to have emotional outbursts from time to time, so you need to give them plenty of encouragement and attention to keep them healthy and happy.\n\nHuman: Are there any laws about owning a potbelly pig as a pet?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: I heard that Potbelly pigs make great pets and I'm thinking about getting one.

How does that sound?\n\nHuman: I was really hoping you could tell me what would make a good compilation - I want suggestions for songs in the rock genre\n\nAssistant: That sounds really interesting.  I think the best way to know what you would like is to just play you some of the songs that I think would make a good mix tape.  I think it would also be fun to pick out some songs that you haven\u2019t heard before, and let you listen to those too.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I stop myself from experiencing road rage?\n\nAssistant: Is there something specific that frustrates you?\n\nHuman: People who cut me off in traffic.\n\nAssistant: Would it help if you thought about what these drivers are going through?\n\nHuman: Maybe, how do I put myself in their shoes?\n\nAssistant:", "response": "\n\nHuman: How can I stop myself from experiencing road rage?\n\nAssistant: Is there something specific that frustrates you?\n\nHuman: People who cut me off in traffic.\n\nAssistant: Would it help if you thought about what these drivers are going through?\n\nHuman: Maybe, how do I put myself in their shoes?\n\nAssistant: There\u2019s a lot of variety, from the totally unconcerned to the fully-rigged-critic:type person.  It can be hard to know what to do with all those emotions, but I have a few suggestions.  I think the first step is to stop thinking about the problem and start thinking about the solution.  I know it sounds crazy, but it works for me.  I try to imagine myself in the driver\u2019s seat of that car, the person who\u2019s driving down the road.  What would they want to do if they\u2019re stuck in a traffic jam?  What would they want to say to the other drivers around them?  I try to imagine myself making that conversation with the other drivers, and it helps me see things from their point of view.  It also helps me realize that I was probably acting in ways that were unkind or ungrateful, and that might be part of the reason why other people get road raged.  So the next time you\u2019re stuck in traffic, try to think of something nice to say to the person next to you, or to the driver in the car next to you, or to the driver across the road.  Maybe you don\u2019t have to say anything, maybe it\u2019ll just make the situation better if you\u2019re being kind to each other.  Try it, and see what happens.  I think you\u2019ll be surprised by how often people respond well to more even-handed treatment, and it\u2019s probably good to know that you can still be kind to others even if you\u2019re feeling road-ragey."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I want to sew a fitted sheet for my queen sized mattress and want to know how much fabric to buy.\n\nAssistant: OK, so sewing fitted sheets can be a bit tricky because of how the threads twist on the bed if they\u2019re sewn tightly, but that can be done, you just need to make sure to have a minimum of 1/4\" of seam allowance around the edges of the mattress. That\u2019s because the mattress flexes on all sides, and so it can move the fabric from its intended position if it\u2019s sewn too tightly.

So how about if I just calculate the amount of fabric that you\u2019ll need by multiplying the width of the fabric by 15?  That\u2019s 225 feet of fabric in total.  Is that enough for the fabric that you have?  If it is, great, I can just get you some more if you need more.  If not, could you tell me more about the fabric that you have, like what kind and how much does it cost?  That\u2019ll help me know what to look for when I go to the store."}

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: Have many people executed on death row been later found to be innocent?\n\nAssistant: If we can be honest with each other, the fact is that in modern times, there have not been many people actually executed in death row cases in which the defendant was found to be innocent of the crime after their execution. In a number of cases, the defendant was found to be guilty, but they were spared execution due to the change of heart of the governor or because the governor was impeached and replaced by another person. Some other cases have been overturned because of legal or other issues, such as new evidence or appeals and challenges by defense lawyers.  There is also the small category of executions of people who were found to be innocent after their executions. In general, very few people on death row have been exonerated or pardoned or released.\n\nHuman: So everyone executed by the state has been guilty?\n\nAssistant: This is a more complicated question that you asked.  It is true that there have been some cases where a person on death row was actually found to be innocent, and thus executed.

The laws and evidence are set by the government\uff0cand they apply equally to all people\uff0cregardless of whether they are on death row or not.  As for the people on death row\uff0cit is important to remember that they are innocent until proven guilty via a fair trial and legal process.  Their lives are at risk, but they are not criminals and are entitled to due process and legal protections.  You may also want to read about the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution\uff0cwhich provides protection against cruel and unusual punishments.  This means that states cannot execute people for crimes that they were found not guilty of.  I hope you find this information helpful.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I make my own baguettes at home?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.

This is where water therapy can help.  You sit in a pool with your limbs under water\uff0cand the water supports you as you move your limbs.  There are different methods for using water to help with mobility, but the principle is the same - it helps you move your limbs more easily and safely, and you have to do it on your own, so it\u2019s also a training for using your muscles later on.  This is particularly useful if you have suffered from a stroke or had a back injury where you can\u2019t move your limbs well."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm curious about the book  Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. Whats the general plot?\n\nAssistant: El inca or Don Quixote de la Mancha was a novelist and an early Spanish epic literature. It was written in the early 16th century. Cervantes wrote the book as a fictional tale, written to be as silly as possible. It is an exaggeration of chivalric tales and historical events, often farcical in nature. The story focuses on the exploits of a knight-errant, Don Quixote, who is accompanied by a gentleman named Sancho Panza, his squire, whose word \"reality\" is used as the basis for much of the humor. The story is also told from the point of view of the author, who discredits the tale as nothing more than a comic fantasy. Don Quixote, based on the name of a legendary Spanish nobleman, was at first a simple and good-hearted hidalgo who was obsessed with stories of knights-errant.

Don Quix\n\nHuman: That's a good start, more concise would help. How does the book end?\n\nAssistant: The story begins with Don Quixote trying to prove his skill as a knight-errant in the city of Dulcinea, which is enchanted to look like a woman. He sets off with his squire Sancho and acquires a horsename of Don Quixote de la Mancha. He sets out to capture or kill the traitor Alcinousa, but is unable to do so, and has to ride his horse across the fields, with the assistance of his squire. He arrives in the nearby town of La Manchuela, to the amusement of the local people who recognize him as a false noble. Meanwhile, he falls in love with a local woman, Ines. They get married. The couple live a peaceful life, until Don Quixote is called back to duty by his old friend, the Duke of Leon, whose castle is threatened by the Moors. Don Quixote and his army go to battle, but are defeated and captured by the Moors. The Moors take Don Quixote to the king, who is convinced of his lies and imprisons him in the fortress. He is given little food and is humiliated. In one of the book\u2019s best episodes, Don Quixote tries to kill a prisoner, but is unable to do so, and suffers from fits of delirium. During this time, Ines is told by her husband La Manchuela that he has died and they should go to bury him, but Don Quixote begs her not to go. In the end, he is released and goes to the moors, where he is finally killed by the moors and eaten by the animals by the end, the book concludes with Quixote\u2019s funeral at his home. In"}

The price also depends on the type of ring you want - a simple band on a band, or a larger ring with a stone in it."}
{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: How often should I go to the dentist for cleaning?\n\nAssistant: It depends on your age, lifestyle, and risk of caries and gingivitis.  Dental hygiene is very important.

Root canals can be very uncomfortable, but as long as your dentist and specialist know what they are doing, the procedure is often very successful."}

My previous response might have you thinking of it as a \u201ctwo-century war\u201d, which is a pretty common mistake.

{"prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about getting a Chinchilla for a pet. Can you provide me some information on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.  You\u2019ll want to get a young chinchilla that you can socialize with others, and not just its parents, because that will help it be happier in the long-term.\n\nHuman: Do  they not do well on their own? I'm not sure I want more than one Chinchilla.\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are very social, and need to be able to be around other animals as they mature.  If you keep them on their own, they will likely start to act more like a wild animal.  One chinchilla needs about 12 square feet of space, and two would need twice that, so they\u2019d need a very large cage, but it should be comfortable for them.\n\nHuman: What kind of food will I have to feed them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are herbivores.  They\u2019ll eat a range of fruits and veggies, as well as hay and pellets.  You could buy a premixed diet that's specially made for chinchillas, which is a combination of grains, legumes, and vegetables.\n\nHuman: How long could I expect them to live on average?\n\nAssistant:", "response": " on them?\n\nAssistant: Chinchillas are popular as pets because they are sweet, playful, and require relatively little maintenance.

They\u2019re very healthy natured animals, and don\u2019t get very sick.  However, they are susceptible to dental problems from eating so much food, and so I would recommend providing them with good oral care."}

Here are a few that I\u2019d recommend thinking about very carefully:\n\nAre you sure you want to freeze your eggs?\n  ----  \n  You can freeze your eggs any time you want and it\u2019s completely up to you.  But think about how much commitment you\u2019re willing to make.  If you ever want to have kids, you\u2019ll need to have your eggs accessed.  Also, if you decide to freeze your eggs in the future, you\u2019ll need to make that decision before you\u2019re too old to have children.  \n\n  Are you sure you want to freeze your eggs?\n  ----  \n  It can be a very scary experience, but freezing your eggs is relatively straightforward.  And in some cases, it\u2019s actually safer than having a traditional IVF cycle.  For example, one study found that freezing eggs improved the chances of pregnancy for women who are undergoing IVF.  So if you\u2019re really risk-averse, you could even freeze your eggs and only attempt to have children once you\u2019re old enough."}
